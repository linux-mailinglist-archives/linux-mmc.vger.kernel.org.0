Some devices may only return BLK_STS_RESOURCE from .queue_rq(), then more
requests are dequeued from scheduler queue if we always queue batching IOs
to LLD, and chance of IO merge is reduced, so sequential IO performance will
be effected.

Such as some scsi device which doesn't use sdev->queue_depth for
throttling IOs.

For virtio-scsi or virtio-blk, we may stop queue for avoiding the
potential affect.

It isn't related with batching submission, IMO.
