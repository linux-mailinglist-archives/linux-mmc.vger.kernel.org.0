Maybe not, but I think the code just tries to conform to the SD spec.

Can you provide some concrete examples of SDSC cards that support UHS-I?

Not sure I understand this correctly? Can you elaborate a bit more, so
I understand how we deviate from the SD spec here?

As far as I understand the spec, SDSC cards shouldn't support UHS-I.
If we decide to deviate from the spec to support this anyway, at least
we need to know about a couple of cards that actually supports this.

Kind regards
