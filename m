Peak bandwidth is an instantaneous bandwidth used as a floor vote to 
take care
of latency (in this case for DDR). It is a mechanism to vote for floor
frequency to counter latency as opposed to an actual bandwidth 
requirement.

So a client could say I need the clock to run @200 MHz and simply take 
the
bus width times the frequency as the required peak bandwidth vote
(peak bandwidth vote = 200 * bus_width ) and vote for it.

So, we are passing peak bandwidth votes for DDR and CNOC for nom 
frequencies
from device tree.

SDCC clocks are running at Nom. frequenices, which are power driven by 
the cx rail.
The same cx rail will also power driven to DDR clocks too.
So, DDR clocks can also scale upto to Nom. frequenices without any extra 
power drawing
by the cx rail. This will helps to get optimal performance.

So, on doing the math with DDR Nom. frequency (1.3GHz) and also 
considering the Gerogi points
[If some links between nodes consist of multiple channels,
or there is anything specific to the topology or the hardware platform
(scaling factors, buswidth, etc), this should be handled in the
interconnect provider driver.] we will get values close to 5400000KBps.

same applies to CNOC config path Nom. frequency (403MHz), we will get 
values close to 1600000KBps.

math used :
peak bandwidth  = minimum DDR * effective width;  //4bytes for DDR for 
SC7280.
average bandwidth = is the actual throughput requirement.

By considering the above points, the new b/w values looks as below.


opp-384000000 {
                                 opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <384000000>;
                                 required-opps = <&rpmhpd_opp_nom>;
                                 opp-peak-kBps = <5400000 1600000>;
                                 opp-avg-kBps = <390000 0>;
                 };


similarly for 100Mhz


opp-100000000 {
                                 opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <100000000>;
                                 required-opps = <&rpmhpd_opp_low_svs>;
                                 opp-peak-kBps = <1800000 400000>;
                                 opp-avg-kBps = <100000 0>;
                 };

Sure, we will update this Average bandwidth vote values.
