Hi Ulf,

Seems some setting issue with my thunderbird application.
Sorry for spams, please ignore my last responses as unsupported
characters got added.

Typing my response again from browser and re-sending.

Thanks,
Ram

Switching modes would incur some latency for sending commands to switch
modes, but tuning is not needed as most of the emmc devices used now a
days are with enhanced strobe support, so tuning would not add up any
latency as it is not required in hs400 enhanced strobe mode.

This feature is implemented for video playback case, where data transfer
request is less, where this feature helps with saving power consumption.

And when there is burst of data transfer request, load will remain 
_high_
so there won't be any switching and hence it won't affect any existing
use cases from latency point of view.

Also if hw supports to switch clk frequency without changing mode. I 
will
make change in code. For this I have seek input from hw team.

 From collected data, I see this feature is helping in saving power
consumption. And no energy penalty is observed. Please share if I am
missing any specific. Power saving using this feature is quite good
and considerable. Please find the data below.

Use Case                             Delta at Battery  Power Impact
30 fps at HD 1080p decode 20Mbps       10 mA               11%
30 fps at UHD 8b H.264 42 Mbps         20.93 mA            19%

I think, generic block layer do not have knowledge of use case for data
transfer request. And devfreq framework have been used to implement this
feature, which should be same in any layer.

Also mobile platforms comes mostly with emmc and ufs as storage media.
And clock scaling is already implemented in upstream ufs driver using
devfreq framework. On similar line, this feature is implemented for mmc
driver. So I believe, clk scaling implementation is better placed in mmc
driver rather in generic block layer.

Test case used are 1080p and 4k video playback use case. As this feature
is implemented specifically for video playback use case.

 From the collected power data, I see this as good reason to have this
feature in mmc driver as number is quite considerable.

For approach, it would be helpful if you share your inputs regarding 
this
approach. And as you have stated, this can be further discussed after a
review from you.
