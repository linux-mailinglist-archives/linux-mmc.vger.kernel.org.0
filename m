Hi Shawn,

FWIW I've also tried suspend on my NanoPC-T4 and seen that the eMMC 
(also HS400-ES) fails to come back properly on resume (thus resume never 
completes due to the missing root filesystem). IIRC it might even have 
been reproducible with suspend-to-idle, but I'd have to double-check that.
