Hi Baolin,

I had a chance to discuss your changes and what other improvements
can be done to the way mmc-blk works with Hannes Reinecke during the ELC
conference. He had some good suggestions. Adding him and the linux-block
mailing list to Cc to make sure I'm correctly representing this.

- For the queue_depth of a non-queuing block device, you indeed need to
  leave it at e.g. 32 or 64 rather than 1 or 2, as you do now (I was wrong
  here originally, but just confirmed that). The queue depth is just used to
  ensure there is room for reordering and merging, as you also noticed.

- Removing all the context switches and workqueues from the data submission
  path is also the right idea. As you found, there is still a workqueue inside
  of blk_mq that is used because it may get called from atomic context but
  the submission may get blocked in __mmc_claim_host(). This really
  needs to be changed as well, but not in the way I originally suggested:
  As Hannes suggested, the host interrrupt handler should always use
  request_threaded_irq() to have its own process context, and then pass a
  flag to blk_mq to say that we never need another workqueue there.

- With that change in place calling a blocking __mmc_claim_host() is
  still a problem, so there should still be a nonblocking mmc_try_claim_host()
  for the submission path, leading to a BLK_STS_DEV_RESOURCE (?)
  return code from mmc_mq_queue_rq(). Basically mmc_mq_queue_rq()
  should always return right away, either after having queued the next I/O
  or with an error, but not waiting for the device in any way.

- For the packed requests, there is apparently a very simple way to implement
  that without a software queue: mmc_mq_queue_rq() is allowed to look at
  and dequeue all requests that are currently part of the request_queue,
  so it should take out as many as it wants to submit at once and send
  them all down to the driver together, avoiding the need for any further
  round-trips to blk_mq or maintaining a queue in mmc.

- The DMA management (bounce buffer, map, unmap) that is currently
  done in mmc_blk_mq_issue_rq() should ideally be done in the
  init_request()/exit_request()  (?) callbacks from mmc_mq_ops so this
  can be done asynchronously, out of the critical timing path for the
  submission. With this, there won't be any need for a software queue.

Hannes,

Let me know if I misunderstood any of the above, or if I missed any
additional points.
