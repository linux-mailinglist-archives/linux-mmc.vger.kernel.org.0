Subject: [<PATCH v1> 3/9] mmc: host: Add device_prepare pm for mmc_host

From: Vijay Viswanath <vviswana@codeaurora.org>

mmc_host is a virtual device and it doesn't have any pm ops and so during
pm registration of device, no_pm_callback gets set as true. The
mmc_host device is not runtime enabled as it is a virtual device and
mmc_host is the parent device of mmc_card. As the mmc_host is runtime
disabled, mmc_card can runtime suspend/resume without depending on
state of mmc_host during normal operations. During system suspend, the
direct_complete flag of mmc_host device gets set as it has no pm_ops.
When mmc_card successfully suspends, it clears the direct_complete flag
of its parent (mmc_host).

But in certain cases during dpm_suspend, an async error can occur after
suspend work for mmc_card is scheduled and before it gets executed. In
that case, mmc_card suspend work will not clear the direct_complete flag
of mmc_host. When mmc_host suspend comes after that of mmc_card,
it too will skip all actions.

But by this time, the mmc_host device has been added to device_suspended
list. So during resume, mmc_host resume will do dpm resume of mmc_host.
In dpm_resume, all devices which has direct_complete flag set will be
runtime_enabled. This is because, in dpm_suspend, any device with
direct_complete flag will be runtime_disabled. Thus, mmc_host which has
direct_complete flag set, will get runtime enabled during dpm_resume.
This is a problem in pm framework with direct_complete flag
(runtime enabling a device in resume when it was not runtime disabled
in suspend path).

Now that mmc_host device is runtime enabled, to runtime resume the
mmc_card, the pm framework will try to runtime resume the mmc_host
device as well and will fail. This prevents mmc_card from runtime
resuming after a runtime_suspend.

Fix this by adding a dummy suspend_prepare() fn for mmc_host. This
prevents the direct_complete flag of mmc_host device from getting set.
