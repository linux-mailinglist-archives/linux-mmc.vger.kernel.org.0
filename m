The software timeout is meant to catch cases where the hardware
timeout has failed, but SDHCI also supports a mechanism to use
software timeouts when the timeout is too big for the hardware
 - refer SDHCI_QUIRK2_DISABLE_HW_TIMEOUT and sdhci_calc_sw_timeout()

Historically, R/W timeouts were never longer than 2.5 seconds.
(5ms x 5 x 100 == 2.5s), so 10s has been enough ever since the
driver was written around 2006

Longer timeouts are for erase etc, but they are now always set
in cmd->busy_timeout.

So 22s is a strangely long timeout for R/W operations, and I would say
even 10s is longer than we really want.

One option would be to make it a variable that host controllers
can re-assign if needed e.g.
