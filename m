Hi, I'm coming back to this issue now. The issue is still present in
kernel version 5.4.8.

Kernel logs from boot with SD card and black screen: https://termbin.com/outp
Kernel logs from boot without SD card: https://termbin.com/dc2y

I couldn't find anything conspicuous in there, the card is working as
expected. Only issue is the black screen (I'm doing these tests via SSH).

lspci output: https://termbin.com/x452

How do I figure out which mmc host driver is in use? I assume I'm
looking for one of these https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/drivers/mmc/host
I couldn't find anything like it in the kernel logs or from lsmod.

Please read the original bug report by Pedro Rodrigues quoted above.
He got to the technical core of the problem already and proposed a fix
I assume could be understood, sanity checked and implemented by a mmc
maintainer.

Regards
Tim
