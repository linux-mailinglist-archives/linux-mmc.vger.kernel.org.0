Hi,

I made some extra tests, and the timeout value set in MMCIDATATIMER 
correspond to the one computed:
card->ext_csd.erase_group_def is set to 1 in mmc_init_card()
In mmc_mmc_erase_timeout(), we have:
erase_timeout = card->ext_csd.hc_erase_timeout; // 300ms * 0x07 (for the 
eMMC card I have: THGBMDG5D1LBAIL
erase_timeout *= card->ext_csd.sec_erase_mult; // 0xDC
erase_timeout *= qty; // 32 (from = 0x1d0000, to = 0x20ffff)

This leads to a timeout of 14784000ms (~4 hours).
The max_busy_timeout is 86767ms.

After those 4 hours, I get this message:
mmc1: Card stuck being busy! __mmc_poll_for_busy

The second erase with MMC_ERASE_ARG finds an erase timeout of 67200ms, 
and uses R1B command.
But as the first erase failed, the DPSMACT is still enabled, the busy 
timeout doesn't seem to happen. Something may be missing in the error path.

Anyway, I'll push an update of the second patch of the series, and just 
drop this first one.


Regards,
Yann
