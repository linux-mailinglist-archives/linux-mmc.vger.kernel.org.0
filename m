It happens in the same place, cqhci-crypto.c.  Mediatek's eMMC inline encryption
hardware follows the eMMC standard fairly closely, so Peng's patch series just
sets MMC_CAP2_CRYPTO to make it use the standard cqhci crypto code, and does a
couple extra things to actually enable the hardware's crypto support on Mediatek
platforms since it isn't enabled by default.  (*Why* it requires an SMC call to
enable instead of just working as expected, I don't know though.)

The way all this gets used is via the blk-crypto framework
(Documentation/block/inline-encryption.rst), which is used by fscrypt
(ext4 and f2fs encryption).

Peng, if you could explain all this properly in the cover letter, commit
messages, and code comments (where it makes sense), that would be really helpful
for people.  Also please make sure your patch series is in a thread so that
people see it together.
