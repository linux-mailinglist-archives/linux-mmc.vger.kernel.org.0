No problem. Reviews are for twisting and turning the code.

To twist it even more, there is no real need to use DIV_ROUND_UP(_ULL)
on the clkdiv division right? I mean the round up has already been made,
and it shouldn't be needed twice?

So,
	tmp = DIV_ROUND_UP_(ULL)(tmp, clk_div);

could be a

	tmp /= clk_div;
