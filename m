Agree.

Average bandwidth being higher than peak does not make sense to me.
The numbers in DT should reflect the real bandwidth that is being
requested. If some links between nodes consist of multiple channels,
or there is anything specific to the topology or the hardware platform
(scaling factors, buswidth, etc), this should be handled in the
interconnect provider driver. The goal is to use bandwidth values and
not magic numbers.
