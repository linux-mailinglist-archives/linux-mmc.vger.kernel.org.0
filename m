I'm a bit confused now, if the problematic commit is going to get
reversed then technically we don't need this series anymore ?

Or are you planning on re-introducing it in some form for 5.17 ?

With that said getting this series merged would still be good,
patch 1 + 2 make the existing always_present quirk code more generic
which might be useful later. And then patch 3 (which is small)
allows dropping some ugliness from the sdhci-acpi.c code since
the DSDT bug we are hitting will now be solved by the
new acpi-dev-status-override mechanism.

Regards,

Hans
