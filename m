I've been struggling to track where things were working, where things
were broken, and what/why Shawn's original fix was, precisely. So you
may be correct in many ways :) Thanks for looking.

You may be partially right, or fully right. But anyway, I think I have
some additional explanation, now that you've pointed that out: that
behavior changed a bit in this commit:

08573eaf1a70 mmc: mmc: do not use CMD13 to get status after speed mode switch

While that patch was merged in July 2016 and Shawn submitted his v1
fix in September, there's a very good chance that a lot of his work
was actually done via backports, and even if not, he may not have been
testing precisely the latest -next kernel when submitting. So his fix
may have worked out for _some_ near-upstream kernel he was testing in
2016, you may be correct that it didn't really work in the state it
was committed to git history.

This may also further explain why my attempts at bisection were rather
fruitless (notwithstanding the difficulties in getting RK3399 running
on that old of a kernel).

Anyway, I'll see if I can improve the messaging if/when a v2 comes around.

I believe either worked in practice. I ended up choosing hs_max_dtr
because it's lower and presumably safer. But frankly, I don't know
what the Right thing to do is here, since the spec just talks about
"<=", and yet f_init (which is also "<=") does not work. I think it
might be like Ulf was guessing way back in the first place [1], and
the key is that there is *some* increase (i.e., not using f_init).

So assuming either works, would you prefer hs200_max_dtr here, since
that does seem like the appropriate final rate?
