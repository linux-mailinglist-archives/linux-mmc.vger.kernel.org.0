Ben is the primary author and can respond on the requested code
changes; I helped break the work apart into the two patches and
did small changes to improve the code.

Ben's SMTP server at Genesys auto-appends the confidentiality
notice without giving him the opportunity to control it.  I have
the patch set co-developed in a shared Git repository without the
automated email addition ever applied, so when Ben works out the
substantial changes, I can send final patches to the list without
the mail-mangling robot getting in the way.  He'll still be the
primary author.
