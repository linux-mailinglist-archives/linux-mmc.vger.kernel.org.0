I think you have misunderstood the intent with the series that I
posted [1] a while ago. The idea was to add the foundation of what
should be needed in the mmc core to support UHS-II cards. Note, it's
only the foundation, not the complete code.

In other words, I think you should base the next version of $subject
series *on top* of my series [1], rather than the opposite.

Moreover, next time, please try to better describe in each changelog
and in a cover letter what you have changed and why, as it helps me to
review.

Kind regards
Uffe
