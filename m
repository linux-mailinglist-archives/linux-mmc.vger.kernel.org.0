I guess I would need to turn that around and ask what
kind of documentation would convince you?

I guess this isn't enough:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/block/bfq-iosched.html

To be clear, "works better" in this context means, solving a problem
for the interactive user, preventing random freezing of the UI on
resource-limited (memory, disk throughput) systems under high
I/O load.

Not maximizing throughput in general, which is the common
misunderstanding.

I personally ran into it, and blogged about it:
https://people.kernel.org/linusw/bfq-saved-me-from-thrashing

The phenomenon of freezing UI also happens on e.g. Android
while updating the apps in the background as illustrated by Paolo
here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANfqNiJVoVE
More demos on more devices (mostly MMC/SD):
https://www.youtube.com/user/valentepaolo/videos

He also has several practical measurements of it and a test suite:
http://algogroup.unimore.it/people/paolo/disk_sched/results.php

There are also peer-reviewed IEEE articles and what not.

The problem it solves appears on slow single-queue
devices where the scheduler cannot distinguish importance
between processes and treat all processes the same.

It does not try to solve the problem of maximizing throughput
on a real fast MQ device.

For MMC/SD-based systems this is very real, and that is why
this is implied by a patch to the MMC/SD subsystem.

Embedded interactive devices use MMC/SD-cards, while enterprise
storage systems does not.

This is why the udev rule in RedHat/Fedora looks like this:

60-block-scheduler.rules

ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="block", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="disk", \
  KERNEL=="mmcblk*[0-9]|msblk*[0-9]|mspblk*[0-9]|sd*[!0-9]|sr*", \
  ATTR{queue/scheduler}="bfq"

Targetting most slow single-queue devices with BFQ.

SuSE has something similar:
https://github.com/openSUSE/udev-extra-rules/blob/master/60-io-scheduler.rules
