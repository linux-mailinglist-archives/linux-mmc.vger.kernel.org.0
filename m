I was suggested to add shutdown callback by memory team to gracefully 
de-register with smmu driver
during reboot/shutdown. So tried adding it. Since SMMU team.

I just need to ensure that controller is not active anymore and not 
accessing memory related to any
requests and de-register with smmu driver during shutdown.
