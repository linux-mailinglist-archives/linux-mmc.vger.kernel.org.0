Consider to join with a Standard or Pro Membership
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Either if you are a Musician or a Music Employer, have a look at our Member=
ship Plans and sign up for the one that best fits your needs:


http://www.musicianspage.com/membership.html


A Standard or Pro Membership gives you the ability to upload unlimited audi=
o, video, and sheet music files to your profile; as well as a more complete=
 resume (or service/company info if you are an employer) and a creative pag=
e with media content. If you are a musician, you will also have the chance =
to get featured on the new Musicians Page radio:

http://www.musicianspage.com/music/radio/


Musicians Page gives you a professional space on the web to showcase your t=
alent to potential employers or, for employers, to have a professional and =
targeted space on the web where to showcase your products or services to po=
tential prospects. Musicians Page gives you the chance to differentiate you=
rself from other musicians or the competition who only use amateur channels=
 such as MySpace, FaceBook, YouTube, or other free sites.

Also, do you know that your profile on Musicians Page is Google optimized?

This means that employers, other musicians or prospects can easily find you=
 via Google. Our system automatically optimizes every Musician's profile to=
 appear at the top of Google results for relevant keywords. Just another re=
ason to take full advantage of all that the Standard and Pro Memberships ha=
ve to offer, and not rely solely on free social networks that won't optimiz=
e your profile for others to see at the top of the list!

With a Standard or Pro Membership, you'll also be able to find and apply fo=
r external jobs Musicians Page finds for you on the web (if you are a music=
ian) and, with a Pro Membership, be notified via email as soon as a new ext=
ernal jobs, matching your profile, are found. Or, if you are an employer, b=
e featured prominently on any webpage of our site to over 2,000 unique user=
s daily.

Musicians Page is a network for professional musicians and music employers,=
 built and planned to grow based on professional musicians' and music emplo=
yers' needs. Don't miss the opportunity to jump on the band wagon from the =
beginning.

Membership fees are likely to be increased in the coming weeks, so join Mus=
icians Page today and start networking the right way!
