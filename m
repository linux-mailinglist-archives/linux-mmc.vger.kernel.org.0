Hi,

If you can easily reproduce it might be worth to just try bisecting; 
that could be faster than manually poking around in the code.

Also, it would be worth having a look at the state of upstream Linux. 
Upstream Linux developers tend to not care about minor performance 
regressions on oldish kernels.

There has been work on improving exactly the situation you are 
describing -- a "fail fast" / "no retry" mode for alloc_contig_range(). 
Maybe it tackles exactly this issue.

Minchan is already on cc.

(next time, please cc linux-mm on core-mm questions; maybe you tried, 
but ended up with linux-mmc :) )
