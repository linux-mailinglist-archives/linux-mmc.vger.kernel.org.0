Sorry if I was not clear in previous mail. suspend-to-ram and resume works
fine if the machine doesn't mount internal emmc card to use it in way.

If it boots from external mmc card or ssd disk attached over usb-c
interface and use root filesystem (or any other filesystem, /home for
example) on them (external mmc or disk on usb-c) it can go numerous
times to suspend-resume cycles without any problem.

But if any filesystem from emmc mounted then in can suspend and even
resume, but when resumed after some random time it start to make
problems: programs segfault, cant read or write files and similar
issue.

As I wrote in previous mail I can apply patches, build kernel and
(maybe) tweak some parameters in kernel source (if I know which one
should help me) to help subsystem developers to fix this problem.
