In general I don't mind the idea of giving hints from lower layer
block devices, about what kind of scheduling algorithm that could make
sense (as long it's on a reasonable granularity).

If I understand your point correctly, what you are saying is that it
isn't easy or even possible for some block devices HWs. However, that
should be fine, as it wouldn't be mandatory to set this kind of flags,
but
instead could help where we see it fit, right?

Kind regards
