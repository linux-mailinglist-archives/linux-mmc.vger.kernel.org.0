This is probably a local change present only in your own tree, because
I don't see this anywhere in the v3 series.

In any case, it's not obvious to me why you need to set it exactly at
this point. Can you clarify why?

Perhaps, as I stated before, it's time to post the entire series,
including the host driver changes. In this way, I should be able to
get the complete picture.

I couldn't find where MMC_UHS2_APP_CMD was getting set, but I assume
you have some local changes that make it set in mmc_app_cmd() then.

I decided to have a closer look at this. Instead of using a flag
(MMC_UHS2_APP_CMD) for this, let's re-work the code so it becomes
possible to prepare the "uhs2_cmd" in mmc_app_cmd() too. That means,
from mmc_start_request() we need to check if the mmc_cmd->uhs2_cmd has
already been assigned and then just leave it as is.

I assume you mean that if both the card and the host supports Range B
speed mode for UHS-II, we should try to switch to it.

Then I have two follow up questions related to this.
1) Is there some specific need to inform the host driver, in the
progress of switching to the new speed mode, to make this work? I
would believe so, but I don't have the complete picture.
2) After a successful switch to the new speed mode, we should keep
track of that we are running in this mode. In this way we can report
this in logs/debugfs. How do you intend to do this?

What does "driver can access UHS2 interface" really mean? Is it that
the card is ready to accept SD-TRAN commands, for example? Can you try
to be a bit more precise, please?

Let's see where the discussion brings us. Although, "state" is rather
confusing - and it's inconsistent with the ways things are implemented
for the legacy interface.
