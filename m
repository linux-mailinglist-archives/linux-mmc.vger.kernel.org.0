I had guessed that.

Correct, but if you already have this custom SMCCC for voltage already
implemented in TF-A, I don't see it is a big deal to support voltage
protocol there.

Sorry absolutely no. If this platform was not using SCMI, I wouldn't have
pushed back hard on this custom SMCCC. Please update TF-A to add this support.
There is no point in having custom interface just for this when everything
else is already using SCMI on this platform.
