Exactly. Thought I think most controllers reset fast enough to where
that window is very small. But for this AMD controller we need to do a
full reset which takes a while, so we can see the problem.

I'll let Adrian chime in here.

Yeah, I could add `mmc_detect_change()` to the AMD SDHCI patch. I just
thought it would be better to fix the potential race condition at a
higher level. Though I'm happy to move it to the AMD patch. Let me know.
