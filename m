I would be more interested in something like below (completely untested).
Thoughts?

Subject: [PATCH] mmc: sdhci: Add module param debug_spec

End users can have linux compatibility issues. SDHCI provides 2 module
params to help debug such issues: debug_quirks and debug_quirks2. Those
have 3 limitations:
 - they apply to all devices instead of a specific device
 - they overwrite all quirks instead of specific bits
 - they do not cover capabilities
Add a new module parameter debug_spec which addresses all 3 limitations.
