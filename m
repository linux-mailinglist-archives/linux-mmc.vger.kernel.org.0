No idea if this would still work, but back before label/uuid and lvm
in initird I had a staticly linked "C" program that ran inside initrd,
it searched for likely places a boot device could be (mounted them and
looked for a file to confirm it was the right device, then unmounted
it), and when it found the right one, it then echo's is major/minor
numbers into /proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev and that is used for root=
without it being on the command line.  Assuming you could get
something similar started by sytemd and/or udev inside the initrd it
might still work.
