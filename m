You can disable runtime PM per device via sysfs. (Something like:

	echo on > /sys/devices/.../power/control

=2E) The docs say "Changing this attribute to "on" [...] while the device
is suspended causes it to be woken up.", so the right thing seems to
happen. (I didn't test what happens if that file is written before the
driver is bound.)

Uwe
