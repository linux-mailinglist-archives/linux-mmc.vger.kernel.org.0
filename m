I have a question about the return type of this function. In
sd_uhs2_set_ios(), we only called
host->ops->set_ios() and the return type of that function was VOID. So
is there a reason
that this function must has a non-void return type?

I will try to do that.

There are 5 callback functions for UHS-II:
    int   uhs2_detect_init(struct mmc_host *host);
    int   uhs2_set_reg(struct mmc_host *host, enum uhs2_action act);
    void uhs2_disable_clk(struct mmc_host *host);
    void uhs2_enable_clk(struct mmc_host *host);
    void uhs2_post_attach_sd(struct mmc_host *host);
According to your suggestion, I plan to integrate them into a single function,
named "uhs2_do_action", since they all realize the specified function by
setting the controller.

Okay. The string will be modified in the next version.

Do you mean to create a separate patch which only contains typo correction?
If yes, should I collect such changes in previously submitted files
and put them to
a separate patch file  in the next version, even though they are the
same between
previous and next version? Or just apply this rule to later versions?

Agree. I will try to do it in the next version.

Agree. As mentioned above, I plan to use uhs2_do_action to  replace 5 UHS-II
callback functions. And I will check (host->ops->uhs2_do_action) at
the beginning
of the initialization process.

As I mentioned above, I intend to use integrated "uhs2_do_action()".
What do you think?

Oops! I missed it accidentally in the previous version. I will update
it in the next version.

I will remove this callback and reorganize codes in this portion.

This topic can be discussed.
The ios structure can continue to be used after adding new definitions to
certain fields, for example, adding MMC_TIMING_UHS2 for ios.timing.

You are right. I will reorganize this portion.

Agree. I will move the "flags" field to struct sd_uhs2_caps{} in the
next version.

UHS-II speed mode is only set at initialization phase and it is not
changed before hardware reset.
Hence, I think it's not necessary to place sd_uhs2_change_speed() into
host->ios_uhs2.*.
Maybe we can discuss host->ios_uhs2.* after you check my next submission.

I will reorganize this portion to fix this memory leak.

I will start preparing for the next version submission after receiving
your response to my question.
Thank you for your patience.
