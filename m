Yes, I see.

It should, else it's a bug (I would be really surprised if that's the
case, but who knows).

It should limit the speed, else it's a bug. Can you perhaps check what
the requested clock rate is via some debug prints in the host ops
->set_ios()? And also what the real rate becomes after dividers.

If it's not a bug in the core, I suspect that there may be generic
problem dealing with initialization frequencies for sdhci-tegra.

For example, mmc_rescan_try_freq() tries to initialize the SDIO card
at 400KHz, then 300, then 200 then 100 (in that order, and note
*KHz*). When a frequency is successful, initialization continues and
later on the clock rate should be increased to 25MHz, for legacy speed
mode.

Kind regards
Uffe
