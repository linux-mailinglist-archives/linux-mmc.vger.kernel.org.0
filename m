We have other commands that have R1B responses.

For example, open-ended I/O writes that are completed with CMD12 or
the erase/discard command. Not sure which ones that are easiest for
you to test with, we can chat more about this offlist.

By looking at the above log, it seems like the card does signal busy,
at least occasionally.

1) The print "no busy signalling in time", isn't so worrying to me. It
probably means that the card doesn't need to signal busy, as it's
internal operation is completed. To be absolutely sure, we could
extend the polling loop to more retries, just to test.

2) The print "lost busy status when waiting for busy start IRQ" is a
bit harder to understand. However, my guess is that the mmci
controller does raise an IRQ, to signal a *changed* busy signal state,
which is the most important thing. When we end up reading the busy
status bit to manage the IRQ, we find that the card has stopped
signalling busy. That seems perfectly fine to me. So, maybe we don't
get the start IRQ (as that state wasn't discovered) but only the end
IRQ, so to say.

More importantly, the busy timeout work never gets to run, which
indicates that we are no longer hanging and waiting for an IRQ to be
raised. Is that correct?
