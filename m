This is a bit misleading and makes it sound like we've got a bug. In
truth the Linux driver looks at the compatible string. If it sees any
compatible listed as "v5" (or a slight variant of v5 to handle a
workaround for sc7180 / sdm845) then it _doesn't_ expect 'core' reg as
the second entry. See the variable `mci_removed`. The old bindings
".txt" file also had this to say:

                For SDCC version 5.0.0, MCI registers are removed from SDCC
                interface and some registers are moved to HC. New compatible
                string is added to support this change - "qcom,sdhci-msm-v5".

So I guess that means this is the documentation for all of the
combinations you have listed:

* hc only - v5 controller w/out CQE / ICE

* hc + core - v4 controller w/out CQE / ICE

* hc + cqhci - v5 controller w/ CQE and w/out ICE

* hc + cqhci + ice - v5 controller w/ CQE / ICE

* hc + core + cqhci + ice - v4 controller w/ CQE / ICE

Said another way, before v5 the "core" range existed. After v5 it
apparently doesn't so there's no way we could have specified it.

You'll notice that one of the options above implies that a v4
controller (with "core" specified) can have CQE and ICE. Is this
actually true, or was it a misunderstanding in the .txt to .yaml
conversion?

If it's true that a v4 controller can have CQE and ICE then your patch
is wrong in asserting that v4 controllers have only "hc" and "core".

If a v4 controller _can't_ have CQE and ICE then your patch is right
but incomplete. It should also be removing the option:
          - const: hc
          - const: core
          - const: cqhci
          - const: ice

I am not intimately familiar with Qualcomm MMC controller history.
That being said, the old .txt file said:

        - CQE register map (Optional, CQE support is present on SDHC
instance meant
                            for eMMC and version v4.2 and above)

To me this implies that a v4 controller could _at least_ have "cqhci".
I dunno about "ice". I seem to recall that this was the argument for
why the driver had to use reg-names to begin with and why the driver
looks for "cqhci" by name.
