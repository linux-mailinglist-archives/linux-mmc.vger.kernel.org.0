Thanks for the links!

Are these the ones that you have been using for testing?

Right. I have a whole bunch of old SD cards that I can test. I will
let you know when I have got some time to test some of them.

The main worry (but I may be wrong) I have with the patch is that it
could cause problems for other older SDSC cards, which happens to
incorrectly set the S18A bit. I mean, before UHS-I was introduced in
the SD spec, this bit was just being reserved and potentially it could
have *any* value by the card manufacturer. As I said, let me do some
tests of my older SD cards.

Ah, yes you are right!

We call mmc_sd_init_uhs_card() no matter whether the CCS bit is set.
Certainly this is a bug. Both the card and host aren't designed to
work under these conditions/timings.
