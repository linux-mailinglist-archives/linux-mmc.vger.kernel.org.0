Hi Nehal Shah

There was another specification between those two, namely JESD84-B50.1 eMMC 5.01 which has the same procedure as eMMC 5.1

AFAICT the 5.0 text was almost immediately "clarified" in 5.01 to match the 5.1 text.

So we have only 1 HS400 sequence.  But some host controllers do have issues, which is why there are additional hooks like ->hs400_downgrade() and ->hs400_prepare_ddr()

Adrian
