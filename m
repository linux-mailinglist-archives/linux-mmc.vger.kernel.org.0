dump_stack() maybe would've been nicer FYI.

So my two cents again (something according to this is discussed
surprisingly often recently?):
CMD0 is sort-of unsuitable for this, it doesn't have a response or
a way to signal busy, so the host isn't aware of a CMD0 'completion'.
CMD0 is just a FSM transition, any FTL behavior this may or may not
trigger (and some card manufacturers may or may not have implemented)
are unpredictable and hard to guarantee.
