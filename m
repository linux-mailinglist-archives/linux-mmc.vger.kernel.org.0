Yeah, and many non-mmc drivers can benefit too, which is why I've been
sending several of these patches recently as I optimize boot perf on
the device that's sitting in front of me.  ;-)  I think the idea was
that eventually we'd want the kernel to just turn on async by default
everywhere, but at the time the flag was introduced there were too
many subtle bugs everywhere.  It feels like one way to get to the
point where we'd be confident that this is OK to turn on everywhere is
to just start turning it on in lots of places.  Once enough places
have it on then perhaps that will give folks confidence that it's OK
to turn on by default across the board.

If you'd like, I can post patches to update some other set of MMC host
drivers, either as one giant patch (hard to backport, but not as
spammy) or as a large pile of patches.  I've never played with
coccinelle so I'd probably fall back to doing this by hand.  I could
probably only test on a small handful (I think I have easy access to
dw-mmc-rockchip and sdhci-of-arasan besides the msm one I already
posted), so another option is that I could also just post for those
devices...  ...or we can just hope others will notice and start
posting similar patches themselves after testing.  Let me know what
you'd prefer.  ;-)

-Doug
