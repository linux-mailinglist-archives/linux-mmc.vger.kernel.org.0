I have the same hardware as Mårten (ARTPEC-8) so I don't think my
testing would add much.  We'd ideally need someone with a different
platform to help to test this.

As for the patch itself, it would perhaps be helpful if it were broken
down into three separate patches (not necessarily in the order listed
below) since it's doing three different things:

(1) Increasing the length of the software timeout.

This is the primary reason for the patch since the driver is clearly
using a wrong value for the software timeout for the entire transfer
which is lower than the timeouts required by eMMC chips' TAAC/NSAC and
the controller's timeout for (IIUC) one block.

We haven't seen any problems in practice (yet) though.

(As an aside, if I'm reading the eMMC specs correctly, the TAAC/NSAC
 applies to each block of a multi-block transfer.  If that's the case,
 then the entire transfer could, at least in theory, take several
 seconds.

 Is the data->timeout_ns calculated by mmc_set_data_timeout() supposed
 to be a per-block timeout or a timeout for the entire transfer?)

(2) Not waiting for DRTO on errors.

When attempting to increase the length of the software timeout as in (1)
or to remove it entirely, one realizes that the driver actually depends
on the software timeout to prevent hanging indefinitely when CRC errors
are received during tuning.  It's unclear if this is something specific
to our version of the IP or if this is an old regression in the driver
(given that the driver apparently used to work fine without a software
timeout at some point of time on some platforms.)

So increasing the software timeout length will make each failing step in
tuning take half a second which would increase boot time significantly,
so that's why I think the early exit is needed.

(3) Reducing the length of the hardware timeout.

I *think* this is also to reduce initialization time if there are some
transfers which are meant to time out (without any other errors) which
would now take longer to time out after (1), but this part of the change
could use a bit more rationale.
