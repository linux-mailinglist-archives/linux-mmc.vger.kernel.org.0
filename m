Thanks for the confirmation. I'll get a patch sent to fix it.

Makes sense. I'll see what direction I want to take.

We want to provide a knob for our OEMs so they can choose the best
drive strength for their design. Right now for the AMD controller it's
hard coded to A:
https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/master:src/third_party/kernel/v5.4/drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-acpi.c;l=542

I was hoping to use the SDHCI presets to not introduce a non-standard
convention of passing in the drive strength. I wasn't aware that the
SDHCI driver doesn't use presets for eMMC. So maybe the path of least
resistance is to add an ACPI property that is read by
amd_select_drive_strength. Like `mmc_of_parse` does with
`fixed-emmc-driver-type`. This ensures that both the card and
controller drive strengths are set.

It looks like `host->fixed_drv_type` is only for the card. It doesn't
set the same drive strength on the controller. Is this intentional?

    static void mmc_select_driver_type(struct mmc_card *card)
    {
            int card_drv_type, drive_strength, drv_type = 0;
            int fixed_drv_type = card->host->fixed_drv_type;

            card_drv_type = card->ext_csd.raw_driver_strength |
                            mmc_driver_type_mask(0);

            if (fixed_drv_type >= 0) <--- Never updates drv_type
                    drive_strength = card_drv_type &
mmc_driver_type_mask(fixed_drv_type)
                                     ? fixed_drv_type : 0;
            else
                    drive_strength = mmc_select_drive_strength(card,

card->ext_csd.hs200_max_dtr,

card_drv_type, &drv_type);

            card->drive_strength = drive_strength;

            if (drv_type)
                    mmc_set_driver_type(card->host, drv_type);
    }

I was just thinking we need to keep the drive strengths in sync
between controller and card.


Thanks for reading my long email :)
