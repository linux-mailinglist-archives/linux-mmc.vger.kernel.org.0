Subject: [RFC 0/2] sdhci-iproc CMD timeouts

I'm seeing a rather odd behavior from sdhci-iproc's integration in BCM2711
(Raspberry Pi 4's SoC), and would appreciate some opinions.

The controller will timeout on SDHCI CMDs under the following conditions:

 - No SD card plugged in (the card polling thread is running, CD irq disabled).
 - BCM2711's VPU clock[1] configured at 500MHz or more, lower clocks are OK.

There is no specific command that will time out, it seems random.

Here's what I found out. The SDHCI controller runs at 100MHz, by bumping the
frequency to 150MHz the issue disapears. Might be pure luck, or maybe I hit the
nail and it's proper interference. Can't say.

Regards,
Nicolas

    and emmc2's:
