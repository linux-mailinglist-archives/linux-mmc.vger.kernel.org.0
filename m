Thanks for a very nice description of the problem.

At first glance, this seems like a good idea, but I am not completely
sure, yet. See more below.

This means that a DTB that is screwed up in a way that it has two mmc
aliases with the same index, would be allowed to use the same index.

What will happen when we continue the probe sequence in such a case?

Another concern that could potentially be a problem, is that the
"thread" that holds the reference that prevents ida from being
removed, how would that react to a new mmc device to become
re-registered with the same index?

I wonder if we perhaps should return -EPROBE_DEFER instead, when
ida_simple_get() fails?

Kind regards
