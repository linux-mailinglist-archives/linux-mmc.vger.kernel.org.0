I just use a mkosi generated Debian/sid image..

This is a cool project! I was not aware of it. Thanks for sharing.

I am on a Toradex Verdin board with an i.MX8MM SoM. u-boot is still
2024.01, optee_os from Jens referenced branch, with a little change in:

lib/libutee/include/user_ta_header.h

-#define TA_FLAGS_MASK  GENMASK_32(10, 0)
+#define TA_FLAGS_MASK  GENMASK_32(12, 0)

fTPM is from ms-tpm-20-ref.git on github. Need to check what is in the meta-arm.
Figured out some problems with this regarding OrPolicies used by
systemd-cryptenroll..

Ah, seems to be the same change than above, just limited to the fTPM TA?
Shouldn't it be part of optee_os since it is a capability of it?

Was able to test it. But ended also in TA panic. Will share the details
in another mail.
