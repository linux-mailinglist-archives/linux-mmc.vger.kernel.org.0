I understand that this isn't an easy task, but for sure it should be
doable. There are plenty of less robust SD cards out there, let's just
try to find one and see if we can break it. :-)

You are correct - an initial latency for the *first* I/O request will
be added. On the other hand, if the SD card remains unused after a
system resume, there should be some energy to save, as the card would
then remain powered-off.

Moreover, if we also can avoid breaking the SD card, I'm sure it would
be worth it.

Yes, I understand that part. A proper solution needs to take care of
removable cards, of course. The suggestion to set the slot as
non-removable, was just to try to understand if that would solve the
problem of breaking SD cards.

If the card-detect irq, can be configured as a wakeup source, I think
we should be able to distinguish - if we need to do a power-on
(re-init) of the SD card during system resume or if we can avoid it.

I try to get some time to put together a patch for this, no promises
for when, but I will keep you posted.

[...]

Kind regards
Uffe
