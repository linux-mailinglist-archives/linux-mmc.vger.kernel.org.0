Right, I didn't say the solution we use for mmc is perfect, but it was
the easiest solution at hand at the introduction.

The "emergency reset" is needed, due to broken bootloaders, as I
pointed out earlier.

That said, I don't have any strong opinions around this, whatever
option you pick to rework the code is fine by me. The important point
is that we can continue to support the use cases we need for MMC.

BTW, there was a recent related discussion [1] that you may want to
catch up with too, before you start doing the restructuring of the
restart/reboot code. See the link below.

That would be great, thanks!
