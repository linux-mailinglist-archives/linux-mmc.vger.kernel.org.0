in function msm_get_clock_mult_for_bus_mode(), clk multiplier returns 2, with HS400
DDR52 and DDR50 modes which is called from sdhci_msm_set_clock() and
sdhci_msm_execute_tuning. And in sdhci_msm_execute_tuning(), we are calling
sdhci_msm_dll_config() when SDHCI_HS400_TUNING is set and this flag is cleared
immediately after return. And sdhci_msm_dll_config() is called after that.

Now when the card is supporting HS400 mode, then from mmc_hs200_tuning(),
sdhci_prepare_hs400_tuning is getting called, and there SDHCI_HS400_TUNING
flag is set, and clock set is multiplying the clk rate by 2 in below call stack

msm_set_clock_rate_for_bus_mode
sdhci_msm_execute_tuning
mmc_execute_tuning
mmc_init_card

so this clk rate is doubling only with HS400 mode selection and while setting up
dll in HS400 dll configuration path sup_clk need to divide by 2 as msm_host->clk_rate
is twice the host->clock as mentioned above.
