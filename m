Hey Avri,
Thanks for having a look at this.
Yeah I have indeed only seen ERASE_SEQ_ERROR, but added the rest because it doesn't hurt.
Why would you say ERASE_PARAM shouldn't be checked? Or are you arguing it should only be checked at CMD38 (i.e. the X of CMD35)?
(In which case I agree, just didn't want more than one error mask)
Seeing a ERASE_PARAM would definitely make the erase not happen (that's all mmc-utils should really care about).
ERASE_RESET may be removed for sure, could be checked when a SD ioctl erase fix like I described is in the kernel.
Then an ideal mmc-utils erase operation checks that no relevant R1 bits are set at CMD38 RSP and all CMD13 until card leaves PRG and stops signalling busy.


For an erase call like this:
mmc-utils erase legacy 0 0xFFFFFFFF /dev/mmcblk2

the MMC trace (according to spec and most cards I tried, this is one of them) looks like this:
Format: timestamp,type,CMDOPCODE,
for type 1 (CMD) and type 2 (Resp48) then the next field is arg/response in hex.
I guess rest is more or less self-explanatory / not relevant.
