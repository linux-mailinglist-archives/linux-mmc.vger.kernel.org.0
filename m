The problem is the harcoded 0x0001 as RCA, sdcards have whatever the vendor thinks is right.
I can send a fix for that tomorrow, but generally mmc-utils isn't much useful for SD cards, most mmc-utils features are eMMC-only features anyway.
Softreset works as expected, for byte-addressed we can use grouped wp.
I was thinking about adding TMP_WRITE_PROTECT for both, maybe unlock, too.
And also adapt erase.
Apart from that do you have any features that you can think of?
SD just doesn't have that many features that are used outside of normal IO operation.
Another candidate would be FULE, but cards that support it are rare.

Regards,
Christian

I see. I thought any /dev/mmcblk? device would be supported. The documentation doesn't make this clear. :)

Will something like:

# alias ddcmd='echo $* > /proc/dynamic_debug/control'
# ddcmd 'module mmc_core +p'
# ddcmd 'module rtsx_pci_sdmmc +p'
# mmc status get /dev/mmcblk0
# dmesg | grep -E 'mmc_core|rtsx_pci_sdmmc'

suffice?

Dominik
