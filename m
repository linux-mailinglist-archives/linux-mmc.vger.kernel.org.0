Immune to what exactly?
- (User) data loss of data that is still in the cache of the sd card?
(That would be saved by a timely cache flush)
- (User) data loss of data that should've been written to flash already?
- SD cards breaking?
- Explosions?

(Anything but the first IMO should be fixed by procurement and not by the
kernel, but I'm not sure if that's consensus).

There was a discussion, currently there aren't really, but it depends
on the scenario you're afraid of. Just issuing a cache flush might be fine.

One of the fundamental questions IMO remains: How much time do we actually
have between being notified?

Best Regards.
