I see what you mean, but if you look into what the registers in the
SYSCON blocks actually do it's not clear to me that they should be
grouped with the clocks/resets any more than say the pinctrl/GPIO
node. Maybe it's my fault for not giving you the full picture. Eg. for
"system" and "always-on" there are blocks:

SYS CRG
SYS SYSCON
SYS IOMUX
AON CRG
AON SYSCON
AON IOMUX

..and it really don't see why eg. SYS CRG and SYS SYSCON should be
thought of as one device, but not include SYS IOMUX then.

As an examly the SYS SYSCON includes registers to control:
- remapping of different peripherals from SD controller to video encoders
- voltage select for certain GPIO pins
- phy interface selection for ethernet and CAN
- QuadSPI delay chain and SRAM configuration
- PLL configuration
- endian selection for the SD controller

To me this is pretty much exactly described by the syscon device tree binding:
"System controller node represents a register region containing a set
of miscellaneous registers. The registers are not cohesive enough to
represent as any specific type of device. [..]"
In any case it's clear that however the SYSCON blocks are represented
in the device tree, a driver for it would need to export registers in
the SYSCON block for other drivers to use.
