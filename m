Although HiSilicon has applied for two trademarks Hisilicon/HiSilicon,
there is only one English name for the company. We have consulted with
company's lawyer who suggested that should use a copyright statement
consistent with the official website.

Though the kernel has tons of "Hisilicon", I just fix the copyright,
and plan to send a commit to each subsystem where is uncorrect. Fortunately,
there are not many modules that have the problem, this is one of them.

Thanks.
