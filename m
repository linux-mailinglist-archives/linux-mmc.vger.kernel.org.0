Hi Philip and Chen-Yu

(+Chen-Yu added as He also have the issue for H5)

After reviewing the correct file this time :P

I catched a slight difference between the mainline and vendor driver
in DDR mode.

the phase is set to 1
case MMC_TIMING_UHS_DDR50:
case MMC_TIMING_MMC_DDR52:
dat_drv_ph =3D 1;
speed_mod =3D SM2_HSDDR52_DDR50;
break;

Could you add a hack in DDR mode and see if it's working better ?

Maybe line 738:

#define SDXC_REG_DRV_DL (0x0140)
#define SDXC_DAT_DRV_PH_SEL BIT(17)

rval =3D mmc_readl(host, REG_DRV_DL);
rval |=3D SDXC_DAT_DRV_PH_SEL;
mmc_writel(host, REG_DRV_DL, rval);
