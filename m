I have no problem with that.

However, I have to admit that I still think we have some more work to
do with the patches, before I am ready to queue them. In other words,
the decision is probably best taken a bit further down the road.

Note also that we have other ways of giving companies/people credit,
without using the copyright thing. Like the co-developed by tag and
mentioning companies/people in file-headers and commit messages, for
example.
