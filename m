I have carefully read the specs. While you are right, that the flow
charts seem to prefer to start with UHS-II - I don't think it's a good
idea.

Have a look at "7.2.3.2 Interface Selection after Power Up", in the
UHS-II Addendum Version 2.00. This section states this:

"If Host intends to use only Legacy SD interface or detects that
Legacy SD Card is inserted, it is allowed to supply only VDD1 and
SDCLK, and issue CMD8 in order to accelerate initialization of Legacy
SD interface. Note that once UHS-II I/F is disabled, Host requires
power cycle to enable UHS-II again."

That said, I am also concerned about the case when a bootloader has
initialized the SD card. When the kernel tries to re-initialize the
card during boot, it may fail with UHS-II - unless the legacy SD init
path is tried first.

I see.

If that is the case, I think we should invent an SD quirk for that
particular card. Along the lines of what already exists for SDIO and
eMMC.

So, when a card with this kind of quirk is found, we should simply
bail out in the SD legacy init path and try the UHS-II path instead.

What card have you found missing to set the bit29?

Sure, I will help the best I can.

I will have a look at the next patch in the series as well, but it may
take some time as I am currently trying to get some time off for
holidays.
