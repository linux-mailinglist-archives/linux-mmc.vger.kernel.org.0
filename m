To me, this looks like you may be fixing a very old bug. Unless I am
wrong, it seems like the current code might as well have been:

ocr &= 1 << bit;

The upper bit that the '3' is trying to allow to be set, can in fact
never be set, because we have already done "ocr &= host->ocr_avail" a
few lines above.

Yes, please - so we can discuss it better.

Also, please try to add a relevant comment in the code too, so it
becomes a bit more obvious of what goes on.

Kind regards
