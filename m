Hello Ulf,

Red herring. Apparently the issue is not in the card reader driver but 
in some other new kernel option. If I build the new (5.10.10) kernel 
using the 5.7 config and make oldconfig giving no to all new things then 
the cards are not detected. If I copy the 5.7 config and use make 
xconfig and just save it then it works. I just wonder what this option 
might be and why it is not selected automatically if it is required.

Kind regards.
