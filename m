If the scaling factor is different, maybe this should be reflected
in the BCM data, where we have the following:
     @vote_scale: scaling factor for vote_x and vote_y

This is 1000 by default, but maybe we should set it to some
different value for some of the BCMs?

I'm adding Odelu, who is more familiar with this platform.
