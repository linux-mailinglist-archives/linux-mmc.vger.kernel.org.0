I would prefer if this is addressed in the host driver. Typically in
the host's ->set_ios() callback, before you update the clock according
to ios->clock, you can check the ios->timing value. If the conditions
don't allow to update the clock, just defer it to next time when the
->set_ios() callback is being called, likely having the "correct"
ios->timing.

Would that work?
