Nicolas,

Sorry, I just noticed this thread.
This is a known bug in some newer Arasan cores.
The problem happens when the difference between the core clock and the
bus clock is too great.
Limiting the clock to 200KHz minimum should be a good fix.
In my experience, it's only eMMC that needs the clock to be retried
below 400KHz and not SD or SDIO. That's because the CMD signal for
eMMC starts out as open-drain during identification and the size of
the pull-up on the CMD signal can require the <400KHz clock. Once eMMC
is out of identification mode the CMD signal is switched to push-pull
and can run at much higher clock rates.
I don't think that SD and SDIO have any open-drain signals, so they
shouldn't need to retry at slower clock speeds.
I'm trying to get more detail on the bug, like the exact ratio of core
clock to bus clock that causes the problem. When I first found this
bug I was told that the failure would not happen at 200KHz, but we
were using a 405MHz core clock.

One other question. Why are you using polling for the SD card, this
newer controller supports the interrupt driven "Card Inserted" signal
and avoids wasting time polling?

Al
