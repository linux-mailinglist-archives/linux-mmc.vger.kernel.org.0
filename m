Yes

Yes.  On some hardware, if the timeout interrupt is disabled, and the
operation takes longer than the hardware timeout value, then there is
no completion interrupt.  It is as if the timeout "happens" even if the
interrupt is disabled.

I'm not 100% sure about what happens if the operation completes
before the hardware timeout value, but I think it gets a completion
interrupt same as normal.

Yes, I expect the quirk will do what you need.  Have you tried it?
