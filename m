Hello!

I would like to ask if somebody knows who assigns SDIO vendor IDs?

In SDIO Simplified Specification Version 3.00 available from website
https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/ in section 16.6 CISTPL_MANFID is:

  The TPLMID_MANF field identifies the SDIO Card's manufacturer. New
  codes are assigned by both PCMCIA and JEIDA. The first 256 identifiers
  (0000h through 00FFh) are reserved for manufacturers who have JEDEC
  IDs assigned by JEDEC Publication 106. Manufacturers with JEDEC IDs
  may use their eight-bit JEDEC manufacturer code as the least
  significant eight bits of their SDIO Card manufacturer code. In this
  case, the most significant eight bits shall be zero (0).  For example,
  if a JEDEC manufacturer code is 89h, their SDIO Card manufacturer code
  is 0089h. If a SDIO card manufacturer does not currently have a
  TPLMID_MANF assigned, one can be obtained at little or no cost from
  the PCMCIA.

So IDs 0x0000 - 0x00FF are assigned by JEDEC 106 and because JEDEC 106
contains one parity bit, it means that only 128-reserved IDs are
available for SDIO vendor ids and they were already assigned. This is
basically clear and list of these (id, vendor) tuples can be find in
JEDEC 106 publication.

But who assigns remaining SDIO vendor IDs 0x0100 - 0xFFFF? PCMCIA
website http://www.pcmcia.org/ is already down and according to USB-IF
press information found in document USB_IF_01212010.pdf from archive
https://web.archive.org/web/20160304121938if_/http://www.usb.org/press/USB_IF_01212010.pdf
USB-IF acquired PCMCIA assets which probably means also assigning PCMCIA
vendor IDs.

In archive of www.pcmcia.org is available very old list of vendor IDs:
https://web.archive.org/web/20051202104141/http://www.pcmcia.org/tupleid.htm

I have tried to find some information about PCMCIA or SDIO vendors and
IDs assignment on USB-IF website https://www.usb.org/ but there is
absolutely nothing.

So has somebody any clue what happened with PCMCIA and its relation with
SDIO vendor IDs?
