Yes, I guess they could.

Right.

In any case, I wouldn't mind if we start to poll for these, it sure
sounds a bit more robust.

As I said, the spec is not really clear here. So yes, polling sounds
more safe/robust.

I am worried that it looks like we encourage doing "crazy" things from
userspace, when we add explicit checks for these commands.

In any case, if you strongly think we need these, please add polling
for them (or a subset of them).

Well, I think you are misinterpreting how the buffered writing feature
is working in practice.

The mmc core doesn't write one block at the time and polls for
READY_FOR_DATA/TRAN in between each written block. Instead, it's the
responsibility of the mmc controller HW, to monitor DAT0 during a data
transmission, to understand whether it can continue to fill and write
more buffers.

Kind regards
Uffe
