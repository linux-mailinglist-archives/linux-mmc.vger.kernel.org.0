Sorry, it's just my brain not working properly. Yeah, I think you were
fine assuming it was 32-bit. It seems terribly unlikely that bus_hz
could be anywhere approaching 32-bit max. Even if it was, the timeout
is documented to be max on the order of 80 ms:

/* data timeout (in ns, max 80ms) */

...and even if that's wrong and it's 800 ms _and_ bus_hz is the
absurdly large 0xffffffff then we still don't timeout.

Sorry for getting that wrong. :(
