This is strange as Radxa typically want to align with mmc0=emmc and
mmc1=sd-card, as seen in [3] and [4].

  Align with other Radxa products.
  - mmc0 is eMMC
  - mmc1 is microSD

Also mainline U-Boot for Rockchip SoCs typically always treat mmc0 as
emmc and mmc1 as sd-card, and for most SoCs it will even override the
board aliases to have some predictability across boards.

Yes, my position is that we should use following:

  mmc0 = &sdhci;
  mmc1 = &sdmmc;

I will send out a short sdhci series based on top of v2 of this series.
Driver changes was not needed to get basic sdhci working on RK3528 and
is only required to get HS400 modes working.

This node should be placed above &uart0 to be in alphabetical order.

Thanks for this information, I did not inspect exactly what the v2
tuning meant, only observed that vendor kernel (incorrectly) used a DT
prop to indicate when v2 tuning should be used.

This should also have something like:

Thanks :-)
