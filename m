Controller is connected with its master using NOC and it controls its 
slaves using another NOC path.
So,controller have 2 NOC paths as below.
     a. CPU to Controller, This path is used to access the registers of 
controllers.
     b. Controller to DDR, This path is a data path, where data is 
read/write from/to DDR.
All data transfer will happen on these NOC's, which is shared between 
other peripherals.
In order to achieve required throughput (Data transfer Bandwidth) we put 
vote on these NOC's to
scale the NOC clocks to support required bandwidth.

Instantaneous bandwidth (ib) and Arbitrated bandwidth (ab) values are 
the values calculated (This involves various arch. specific parameters
like clock plans, voltage corners, etc. which varies from vendor to 
vendor and target to target)
to put vote on those noc's to achieve require throughput.

As this is implemented using interconnect framework, "interconnects" and 
"interconnect-names" are required
and below qcom specific properties are required to calculate the ab and 
ib values.

Instantaneous bandwidth (ib) is peak bandwidth and Arbitrated bandwidth 
(ab) is the Average bandwidth.
There is no interconnect binding node as such for expressing the 
bandwidth. Hence the reason to use the
above qcom nodes for parsing and storing the req. bandwidth.

As per the current implementation, these are some optional properties 
and is required
only when the bus bandwidth support is needed and all these are qcom 
specific.
