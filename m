First, thanks for taking a look at this!

The short answer to the remainder of this email is that i'm trying to 
continue supporting existing OSs (windows) using the ACPI tables on the 
rpi3/rpi4 while adding rpi4+Linux support.

An even shorter answer is they don't work because ACPI doesn't provide 
the same clock/attributes/etc controls that exist with DT.

So, what happened here is that I got this controller "working" with the 
generic PNP0D40 sdhci_acpi driver. I managed this only by controlling 
the sdhci_caps/masks in the firmware. In theory this minimizes the 
amount of work needed on the other OS which are booting on the same ACPI 
tables (*bsds). They should only need to quirk the bcm/arasan specific 
functionality, rather than some of the quirking which change the caps 
behavior. But because we don't know which if any of the older rpi/arasan 
quirks are still needed the safest solution is to use the _iproc driver 
and just drop the quirk flags known to be worked around by the firmware 
caps override.

Not really.

Some background: The PFTF is basically the custodian of the combined 
rpi3 port done by Microsoft and a few other peoples/organizations ports. 
That merged code base was upstreamed a couple years ago to edk2 for the 
rpi3 and is the official port. On the rpi3+uefi platform, linux is just 
using DT, but windows and possibly other OSs are using the ACPI tables. 
For the Rpi4, the intentions is to be an ACPI first platform, but we are 
inheriting the rpi3 legacy peripheral descriptions. So, for the past 
year+ everyone has been basing their rpi4 ACPI OS ports on those tables 
and only adjusting them in backwards compatible ways.

Meaning, that a few years back someone put that ID in the rpi3 ACPI 
tables, and now we are stuck with it unless we are willing to break 
other OSs.
