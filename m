Right, card detect IRQs could be useful for system wakeups.

I assume you are using a GPIO IRQ for that, which is easily managed,
as the runtime PM status of the mmc controller is irrelevant when
configuring the GPIO IRQ as wakeup.

We even have a helper for doing this, mmc_gpio_set_cd_wake().

In most cases this should be possible. And so far, for this case, I
haven't found a good reason to why it shouldn't work.

Although, perhaps we need to improve some of the sdhci's library
functions for PM, to better support this.

Kind regards
