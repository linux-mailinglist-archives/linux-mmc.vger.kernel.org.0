Thanks, will fix.

I'm sorry but I fail to follow your calculation here. With 80ms timeout
and 200MHz bus_hz, I get:

80000000 * 200000000 / 1000000000 = 0xF42400

The only way I manage to get an overflow of tmp is with:

timeout = INT_MAX * bus_hz = (value greater than 1000000000) / 1000000000

So my reasoning is that tmp = DIV_ROUND_UP(tmp, clk_div) is safe within
these values, but I can of course make tmp an unsigned long, and in that
case do the clk_div division as:

tmp = DIV_ROUND_UP_ULL(tmp, clk_div)

Kind regards
Mårten
