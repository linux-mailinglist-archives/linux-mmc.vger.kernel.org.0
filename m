Yes, in principle that's correct.

In fact, I think that most host drivers should already support this
behavior, although it relies on the CMD23 to be incorporated within
the same mmc request (mrq) as the CMD25. We use "mrq.sbc" for this and
the host driver uses MMC_CAP_CMD23 to inform the MMC core whether it
supports this or not.

This is not what we proposed, at least if I understood Adrian correctly.

Instead, the idea that could make better sense, is to fix the mmc
ioctl handling in the mmc core, so that it can discover that a CMD23
command is followed by another CMD18/25 (multiple read/write). And in
this case, it should boundle the commands together, using mrq.sbc so
that one request gets sent to the mmc host driver instead of two.

In this way, there should be no need for any specific changes to any
of the host drivers (assuming they have the CMD23 support implemented
correctly), they should just work.

[...]

Kind regards
