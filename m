Subject: [PATCH v4 0/9] eMMC inline encryption support
Date:   Mon,  4 Jan 2021 10:45:33 -0800

Hello,

This patchset adds support for eMMC inline encryption, as specified by
the upcoming version of the eMMC specification and as already
implemented and used on many devices.  Building on that, it then adds
Qualcomm ICE support and wires it up for the Snapdragon 630 SoC.

Inline encryption hardware improves the performance of storage
encryption and reduces power usage.  See
Documentation/block/inline-encryption.rst for more information about
inline encryption and the blk-crypto framework (upstreamed in v5.8)
which supports it.  Most mobile devices already use UFS or eMMC inline
encryption hardware; UFS support was already upstreamed in v5.9.

Patches 1-4 add support for the standard eMMC inline encryption.

However, as with UFS, host controller-specific patches are needed on top
of the standard support.  Therefore, patches 5-9 add Qualcomm ICE
(Inline Crypto Engine) support and wire it up on the Snapdragon 630 SoC.

To test this I took advantage of the recently upstreamed support for the
Snapdragon 630 SoC, plus work-in-progress patches from the SoMainline
project (https://github.com/SoMainline/linux/tree/konrad/v5.10-rc3).  In
particular, I was able to run the fscrypt xfstests for ext4 and f2fs in
a Debian chroot.  Among other things, these tests verified that the
correct ciphertext is written to disk (the same as software encryption).

It will also be possible to add support for Mediatek eMMC inline
encryption hardware in mtk-sd, and it should be easier than the Qualcomm
hardware since the Mediatek hardware follows the standard more closely.
I.e., patches 1-4 should be almost enough for the Mediatek hardware.
However, I don't have the hardware to do this yet.

This patchset is based on v5.11-rc2, and it can also be retrieved from
tag "mmc-crypto-v4" of
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiggers/linux.git

Changed since v3:
  - Added Acked-by and Reviewed-and-tested-by tags.
  - Rebased onto v5.11-rc2.

Changed since v2:
  - Improved comment for sdhci_msm_ice_wait_bist_status()
  - Removed an unhelpful comment in union cqhci_crypto_cfg_entry.
  - Fixed the commit message of "mmc: cqhci: initialize upper 64 bits of
    128-bit task descriptors".
  - Added Reviewed-by's and Acked-by's.

Changed since v1:
  - Only select QCOM_SCM if ARCH_QCOM.  (Fixes a build break.)
  - Split most of the cqhci_prep_task_desc() change into its own patch.
  - Made sdhci_msm_ice_wait_bist_status() use readl_poll_timeout().
  - Added a couple more comments.
  - Added some Acked-by's.
