It sounds like we should give it a try with the CMD12 command for SD
cards as well.

For now, I am fine with adding a new bus_ops callback
(->abort_tuning()) and then let mmc_send_abort_tuning() to call it.

I have some additional plans to improve life cycle issues for the
bus_ops, but let's ignore that for now. I can deal with that later.

That said, mmc_send_abort_tuning() should no longer need to take the
opcode as an in-parameter, thus some additional cleanup should be
needed in a few host drivers because of that.

Would that work?
