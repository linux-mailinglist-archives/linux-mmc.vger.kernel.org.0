In v5.6 the following commits were introduced - and it has turned out
that a few other sdhci controllers had issues with them (which we have
fixed now).

Perhaps you can try a v5.6 kernel and just revert them and see if that
could help - as a start

533a6cfe08f9 ("mmc: core: Default to generic_cmd6_time as timeout in
__mmc_switch()")
ad91619aa9d7 ("mmc: block: Use generic_cmd6_time when modifying
INAND_CMD38_ARG_EXT_CSD")
24ed3bd01d6a ("mmc: core: Specify timeouts for BKOPS and CACHE_FLUSH for eMMC")

Kind regards
Uffe
