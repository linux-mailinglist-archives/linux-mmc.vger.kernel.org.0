sdhci_am654_write_power_on() does have usleep_range() of 1 to 10ms. If
that isn't sufficient to preempt and allow other drivers to probe, then
probably worth setting sleep_us in read_poll_timeout() call.

Above is a good experiment to see if it helps boot time. Can you set
SDCD line to GPIO and hook up using cd-gpios?  You would also need to
set ti,fails-without-test-cd
