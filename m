This still isn't making sense to me.

* sc7180 and sc7280 are running at the same speed. I'm glad the
numbers are closer now, but I would have thought they'd be exactly the
same.

* Aren't these supposed to be sensible? This is eMMC that does max
transfer rates of 400 megabytes / second to the external device. You
have bandwidths listed here of 5,400,000 kBps = 5,400,000 kilobytes /
second = 5400 megabytes / second. I can imagine there being some
overhead where an internal bus might need to be faster but that seems
excessive. This is 13.5x!

* I can't see how it can make sense that "average" values are higher
than "peak" values.

It still feels like there's a misconfiguration somewhere.
