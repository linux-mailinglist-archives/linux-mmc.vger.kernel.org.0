Hello Christian,

Thanks for the prompt response.

Good to know. Thanks.

The kernel isn't modified, but the barebox-state utility can parse the
fixed partitions in the DT and map it via udev to a block device partition
(if one exists) or to a block device + offset.

Yes, but Boot partitions and the user area are different block devices,
so it should be possible to use OF partition for the boot partitions
and GPT for the user area, right?

As mentioned, the kernel itself isn't patched, but there was an implicit
assumption that MBR/GPT parsing would continue to work, even when a fixed
partition node is specified...

If we go this way, the implementation should of course refuse creating partitions
that conflict. The barebox implementation allows partitions only in the
unpartitioned space or to be identical to an existing GPT partition.

But I agree, this needs to be thought through thoroughly to determine how
it should interact with  runtime repartitioning.

Yes, keeping OF_PARTITION disabled would be required to not break barebox
users that made use of the non-upstream binding.

I wonder though, if something can be done to reconcile Linux and barebox'
view of this and allow in the future enabling both Linux OF_PARTITION
and barebox OF partition fixups.

Many of the older boards supported by barebox used to place the barebox image
and the environment prior to the first partition in the unpartitioned area.

To still be able to access them, fixed partitions were used and the rest
of the system was described by MBR/GPT partitions.

This was partially made necessary by BootROMs having strange expectations
of where the bootloader needs to be placed, which partially overlapped
the MBR/GPT itself, making it difficult to define a partition for the bootloader.

For newer boards, it's more common to place the bootloader in a GPT partition
now. barebox has no DT binding for generically describing such a GPT partition
though, so boards may create a fixed-partition "alias" and use that.

Cheers,
Ahmad
