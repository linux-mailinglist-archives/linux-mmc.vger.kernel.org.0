Okay, I see. Thanks for sharing the details.

Right, I understand.

As a simple initial fix, I would suggest you to set
MMC_CAP_NEED_RSP_BUSY for the stm32 variants. This also means you need
to cap the used timeout written to MMCIDATATIMER (when using
MMC_CAP_NEED_RSP_BUSY, cmd->busy_timeout may be greater than
host->max_busy_timeout).

I guess this should work for almost all cases, as 86767ms is rather long.

Long term wise, we need to think of another option. It seems to be
okay to use R1 in favor of R1B and then poll with CMD13. However, in
such cases the controller needs to be reset to move out from DPSM.
Perhaps we can let the core invoke a new callback in the host, to let
it deal with this in some way...?
