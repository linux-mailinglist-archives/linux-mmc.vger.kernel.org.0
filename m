Hi Marcan,

thanks for the detailed description of your experience with the TPM and
secure enclave! This is the kind of thinking and experience we really
need here because it paints the bigger picture.

I am very happy for involving you in this discussion because of your
wide perspective on these features.

I kind of agree.

My position is more like this: different storage media like eMMC,
nvme etc are starting to provide RPMB, so we should provide an
interface to it, harden it and test it, such that trusted systems can
eventually use them, once they get there.

eMMC and NVME already have divergent RPMB userspace
interfaces. The code is already there. An in-kernel interface
and joining the interfaces is under discussion. ($SUBJECT)

Currently engineers are probably concerned with being able to
make use of RPMB in their machines for present day TEE use
cases, but as community we need to think of a future scenario
where we may want to use it, because the abstractions are being
added now, it seems. (Otherwise, in the future, someone is
going to say: "why didn't you think about that from the beginning?")

It's a fine line. Sometimes it becomes just immature up-front
design. Luckily we have people like you telling us off ;)

Yes.

Current use cases involve that key mostly being set in manufacturing
by vendors and accessible to a TEE-like secure world. It fits
them. Their expectation is that the secure world is managed
by them and tightly connected to the root of trust in the machine.

Then we have these random devices which just happen to
have some RPMB on them, sitting around for no reason.
The software such as a Linux distribution has not figured
out a use case.

As a developer, dark silicon is disturbing to me so I try to think
about a use case.

My idea is more like a one-time use seal: the first user of the
machine can use this RPMB store to get some hardware backing
for rollback, pin attempts etc, but once that user is done
with the machine you have no RPMB anymore (unless the
user gives the key to the next user).

If they just reformat the harddrive and lose the key, the ability
to use this hardware is forever gone.

Then software will cope with the situation. Such things
happen.

It is uncomfortable for those of us coming from the world of
generic computing to think about hardware resources as
one-time-use-only but in other strands of life such as medical
needles this is not unheard of, it happens.

I understand your argument, is your position such that the nature
of the hardware is such that community should leave this hardware
alone and not try to make use of RPMB  for say ordinary (self-installed)
Linux distributions?

Yours,
