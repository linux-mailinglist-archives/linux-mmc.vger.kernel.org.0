I'm not sure about this.
As you have explained on IRC, I understand that IRQF_ONESHOT is causing
trouble with RT as the hard IRQ part of the thread will not be migrated
to a thread. That was certainly not the intent when putting this flag.

As described in include/linux/interrupt.h:
 * IRQF_ONESHOT - Interrupt is not reenabled after the hardirq handler finished.
 *                Used by threaded interrupts which need to keep the
 *                irq line disabled until the threaded handler has been run.

The intent was only that, making sure the irq is not re-enabled until
the threaded part is done. AFAIU, removing this flag would allow the
hard irq handler to fire again while we are not done handling the
previous IRQ in threaded part.

This seems pretty unsafe to me. Maybe we could improve the driver so it
copes with this case gracefully. ATM, I don't think it would.

Maybe I missed something and I am happy to be enlightened if that is the
case :)
