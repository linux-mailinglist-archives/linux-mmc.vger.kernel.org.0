Subject: [PATCH V4 0/2] Add SDHC interconnect bandwidth scaling
Date:   Tue,  9 Jun 2020 14:07:24 +0530

Add interconnect bandwidths for SDHC driver using OPP framework that
is required by SDHC driver based on the clock frequency and bus width
of the card. Otherwise, the system clocks may run at minimum clock
speed and thus affecting the performance.

This change is based on
[1] [Patch v8] Introduce OPP bandwidth bindings
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/5/12/493)

[2] [Patch v3 09/17] mmc: sdhci-msm: Fix error handling
for dev_pm_opp_of_add_table()
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/5/5/491)

[3] [RFC v6 2/2] dt-bindings: mmc: sdhci-msm: Add interconnect BW
scaling strings
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/3/23/409)

as there were no extra changes made on [3], retaining the Acked-by and
Reviewed-by sign-off from [3].

Changes since V3:
- Modified the commit message.
- Retained Reviewed-by sign-off from sibi.

Changes since V2:
- Removed debug error prints on icc path ready check.

changes since V1:
- Added dev_pm_opp_find_icc_paths() to check for icc paths.
