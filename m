I try to make the function description more briefly:
/**
 * sd_uhs2_cmd_assemble() - build up UHS-II command packet which is embeded in
 *                          mmc_command structure
 * @cmd: MMC command to executed
 * @uhs2_cmd: UHS2 command corresponded to MMC command
 * @header: Header field of UHS-II command cxpacket
 * @arg: Argument field of UHS-II command packet
 * @payload: Payload field of UHS-II command packet
 * @plen: Payload length
 * @resp: Response buffer is allocated by caller and it is used to keep
 *              the response of CM-TRAN command. For SD-TRAN command, uhs2_resp
 *              should be null and SD-TRAN command response should be stored in
 *              resp of mmc_command.
 * @resp_len: Response buffer length
 *
 * The uhs2_command structure contains message packets which are transmited/
 * received on UHS-II bus. This function fills in the contents of uhs2_command
 * structure and embededs UHS2 command into mmc_command structure, which is used
 * in legacy SD operation functions.
 *

What do you think?
