Ok I've prepared a new version of the patch for this, which resets the
signal voltage to 3.3V at the end of the (runtime)suspend handler using
the Intel DSM and this is only done on the affected model.

I can confirm that this workaround fixes the LCD going black, while
keeping UHS modes working.

I'll send out v2 of this patch-series soon.

Regards,

Hans
