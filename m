DMA support was always optional, because even on systems where DMA is
present, it doesn't necessarily mean the SPI controller uses DMA. In
particular, pure bit-banged SPI via GPIOs doesn't have DMA, but has
always worked. See my previous reply to Christoph about host->dma_dev
for my current-best understanding of what's going on here.

I'll rebuild and retest just to confirm, but I already tested a
functionally equivalent patch that just did the #ifdef inline (rather
than moving the logic out to separate functions) and it worked fine.
