Hi Uffe,

No need to drop this. We could root-casue the issue. Its a board 
specific issue.
This particular platform/board doesn't have external pull-up on the 
cd-gpio pin.

So internal pull-up config has to be applied on cd-gpio all the time.
We posted this dt change to enable internal pull 
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11675347/

Thanks
Veera
