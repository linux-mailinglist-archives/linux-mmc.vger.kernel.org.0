I understand your point, however I don't think it makes much sense to
try to clarify the names on mmc_hw|sw_reset() alone. There are simply
lots of other functions that then would need to be changed too.
Otherwise we would just end up with having even more in-consistency in
function namings. To me, that's even worse.
