That's great to hear.

Makes things much simpler and at this point that will even fix some other
MediaTek SoCs at this point ;-)


> Will send v2 after your register cleanup series accepted.

Please feel free to send your v2 even right now, just add a note (not in the
commit description) saying that your patch is based on top of my series.

That will be fine.

Also, if you could provide a review on my series, that would help speeding up
things :-)

Thanks,
Angelo
