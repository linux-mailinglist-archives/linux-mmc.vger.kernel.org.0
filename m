Sorry for the late response. A combination of holidays and sickness kept me
away from email for a while.

I did see an issue on 5.10 recently but I was running android kernel. I thought
initially the problem is similar to the upstream one we were seeing on mainline
for a while in the past but it turned out a genuine bug due to a patch that
tries to 'fix' softirq interference with RT. Reverting that patch fixed the
issue for me. It turned out later that it was specific to the platform I was
running on and it's not reproducible by others on other platforms.

Upstream 5.10-LTS was fine for me.

HTH.

Thanks
