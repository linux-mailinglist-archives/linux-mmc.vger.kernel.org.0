Unfortunately it doesn't look like it's easy to remove as there is some
behaviour depending on this via dw_mci_drv_data::caps, as well as
different timing setup in dw_mmc-k3.c which uses
dw_mci_of_alias_get_id() to identify SD and SDIO hosts.

Looking across the dw_mmc-*.c files that use dw_mci_drv_data::caps to
set capabilities per host controller:

- dw_mmc-exynos.c sets additional capabilities for mshc0, although both
  MMC_CAP_1_8V_DDR and MMC_CAP_8_BIT_DATA should be set via DT (in fact
  in some cases it looks like device trees are setting bus-width = <4>
  so MMC_CAP_8_BIT_DATA seems wrong!); I can't see any device trees
  setting mmc-ddr-1_8v for these devices at the moment though, so
  removing that is a change in behaviour

- dw_mmc-k3.c sets different capabilities for mshc2 and, as mentioned
  above, uses the alias index to select timing parameters and change
  voltage switching behaviour

- dw_mmc-hi3798cv200.c and dw_mmc-rockchip.c set the same caps for all
  slots, so can easily remove the dependency on the alias


I'm mostly interested in Rockchip myself, which is one of the easy ones,
so I'm not that familiar with Exynos or K3 - I'd guess the Exynos
version can remove its dependency on the mshc alias pretty easily, but
the use in dw_mmc-k3.c looks much more difficult given that I can't see
any other way to derive the necessary info from the current device
trees.

John
