The most relevant commit I've found that is related to enabling DDR speeds
on H6 boards is this one: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/07bafc1e3536a4e3c422dbd13341688b54f159bb .
But it doesn't address the H6 SoC specifically, so I doubted whether it would
be appropiate to mark this patch as fixing it, and opted to not do it. I don't
mind adding that tag if it's appropiate, though :-)

On the other hand, I'm not sure that I understood correctly what do you mean by
this patch going stable, but I might say the changes themselves are stable and work.
The only downside I can think of to them is that they are a kind of workaround that
reduces performance on H6 boards and/or eMMC not affected by this problem (are there
any?), unless device trees are changed.

Thank you for your review. I'll mention that briefly in a comment in the code for
the next revision of this patch.

Regards.
