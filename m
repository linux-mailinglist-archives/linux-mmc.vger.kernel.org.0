IRQF_ONESHOT disables the IRQ at the irqchip level. You must ensure that
the device keeps quite. Usually you mast the interrupt source at the
device lee.

From request_threaded_irq() ->

Just the line that saying what needs to be done before returning
IRQ_WAKE_THREAD.

It is unrelated to RT. Mostly. You end up with the same problem booting
with `threadirqs'. RT has the additional restrictions that you may not
acquire any sleeping locks in hardirq context. This you can see with
addinional lockdep magic.

Puh. That should be forwarded the IRQ department.
So we have IRQF_NO_THREAD to avoid force threading. This is documented
as such. Then we have IRQF_TIMER and IRQF_PERCPU which are also not
force threaded and it is not documented as such. However it is used for
the timer-IRQ, IPI, perf and such - things you obviously don't want to
thread and need to run in hard-IRQ context.

What you have ist a primary and secondary and IRQF_ONESHOT and don't
want the primary handler to be force-threaded. I can't answer why we
don't.
However, drivers usually disable the source themself if they providing
both handler.
