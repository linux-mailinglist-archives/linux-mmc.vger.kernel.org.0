Yes. MMC_UHS2_SUPPORT is only useful in patch set: "Add support UHS-II
for GL9755"
(https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-mmc/list/?series=378627&archive=both).

I will remove it in V4.

MMC_TIMING_SD_UHS2 is used to indicate that host controller is using UHS2
timing now. But MMC_UHS2_INITIALIZED=1 means that UHS2 interface
initialization is complete. The meaning of these two flags are different.

It is set in sd_uhs2_init_card():
static int sd_uhs2_init_card(struct mmc_host *host, struct mmc_card *oldcard)
{
        struct mmc_card *card;
        u32 node_id;
        int err;
        [...]
        if (card->uhs2_state & MMC_UHS2_SPEED_B) {
                err = sd_uhs2_change_speed(host, node_id);
                if (err)
                       return err;
        }

        card->uhs2_state |= MMC_UHS2_INITIALIZED;

        err = sd_uhs2_legacy_init(host, card);
        if (err)
                goto err;
        [...]

}

Indeed, it is more reasonable to put is_APP_CMD in uhs2_cmd. But uhs2_cmd
is allocated in mmc_start_request() and is_APP_CMD is set in mmc_app_cmd(),
which is called prior to mmc_start_request(). So I use this flag as a mark and
check it when filling uhs2_cmd in uhs2_prepare_sd_cmd().

Actually, MMC_UHS2_INITIALIZED and MMC_UHS2_SPEED_B are more
like "is UHS2 interface initialization complete?" and "is current UHS2 sd card
support Range B clock?". They are not configurations but a kind of flags which
are used to tell driver:
    - MMC_UHS2_SPEED_B:     Current UHS2 sd card supports Range B clock
                                                   frequency. Driver
can execute sd_uhs2_change_speed()
                                                   after sd_uhs2_config_write().
    - MMC_UHS2_INITIALIZED: UHS2 interface handshake done. Driver can access
                                                   current UHS2 sd
card with UHS2 interface.

That's why I named it 'uhs2_state'. What do you think?

Kind regards,
