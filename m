Good day my beloved one,

I am writing you these massage to you with tears and sorrow from my
heart. I am Esther Laboso a 23 years old girl from Kenya, My father is
Lorna Laboso the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs who was among the
plane that crash in a remote area of Kalong=E2=80=99s western Kenya. The pl=
ane
crashed occurred on Tuesday 10th, June, 2008. You can read about it in
the below website:

http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/06/10/kenya.crash/index.html


After the burial ceremony of my father, my stepmother and my uncles
conspired and sold my father properties to an Expertriate in
Switzerland and shared the money among themselves and left nothing for
me because I am female child and my mother died when I was only three
years old; One faithful morning, I opened my late father briefcase and
found out a document that my late father deposited a huge amount of
money in a bank in Burkina Faso with my name as the next of kin.

After then I escape to Burkina Faso to withdraw the money for a better
life so that I can take care of myself and start a new life. on my
arrival over here, the Bank Director whom I met in person told me that
my father made an agreement with the bank that the money should be
release to me only when I am married or I present a trustee that will
help me and invest the money overseas. That is the reason I want you a
honest and reliable person to help me and stand as my trustee for the
Bank to transfer the money to your bank account oversea. The amount is
USD$9.4M.

However, You will help me to invest part of the money in a profitable
business venture in your Country. and you will also help me by
recommending a nice University in your country, so that I can complete
my studies. I will compensate you with 30% of the total money for your
services while the balance shall be my capital, to complete my studies
and also to invest in your country with your kind idea.

I shall appreciate an urgent response indicating your ability and
willingness to help me trustfully and sincerely. I thank God Today
that I am out from my country (KENYA) right now In (Burkina Faso)
where my father deposited the money with my name as the next of kin,
and I have confirmed from the bank with the Document I have at hand
which I will be sending to you after receiving a good respond from
you, I will also be sending to you my picture's in my next mail.

Thanks and have a nice day.

Yours sincerely,

Esther Laboso.
