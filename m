You have keembay_sd_voltage_selection function as Michal prefers, I have
no objections for that. But please no keembay_firmware node in DT.
You can implement this as a driver or simple smccc based function library
without DT node using SMCCC get_version. I hope the firmware gives error
for unimplemented FIDs, thereby eliminating the need for any DT node or
config option.
