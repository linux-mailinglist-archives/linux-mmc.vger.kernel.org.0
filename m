The mmc block driver has a CQE *interface* based around struct mmc_cqe_ops,
which was designed for JEDEC eMMC CQHCI.  CQHCI is a host side hardware
command queue engine and it now supports hardware inline encryption.  CQHCI
can only be used with eMMCs that support command queuing.

The mmc block driver CQE interface was later also adopted for a software
based queue called hsq.  hsq does not support eMMC command queuing.

Command queuing is an eMMC card feature.  It does not require CQHCI although
that is all we support at the moment.

ADMA3 is a hardware host-side interface that conflicts with CQHCI.  ADMA3
can be used with both SD cards and eMMC and does not require that a card
supports command queuing.
