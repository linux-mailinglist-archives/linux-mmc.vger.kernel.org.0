I'm happy if it is useful for somebody :-)

It is more than year old... but what I remember is that I was thinking
about it but I realized that SDIO devices and SD/MMC cards are too
different. Also linux kernel provides for them different sysfs nodes
(which mimics what these type of devices provides). So SDIO (for
userspace) does not share too much code with SD/MMC.

I do not have time for this project. This is also why I was waiting more
than year with sdioutils for testing/improving...
