This matches my view with below amendments:
 - Your passage seems to describe a single-duplex communication (one end
   is always a sender and the other one is always a receiver). Since the
   CMD and DAT[0-7] eMMC lines are bidirectional (carrying half-duplex
   data transfers), this is what seems to justify the
   "drive(r) strength/type" feature/setting to be present on both host
   controller and eMMC device ends (which does happen in real life).
 - I am unsure whether to endorse the "totempole output" as being the
   usual foundation for how "drive strength" is really implemented in
   the modern CMOS ICs, based on the following:
   - All eMMC Jedec specs mention "push-pull" for CMD/DAT[0-7]
   - All eMMC device datasheets I could find reference "push pull"
     and none mentions "totem pole" for CMD/DAT[0-7]
   - The "totem pole" topology seems to originate from and be much more
     popular in the TTL/BJT world, where it tries to harness the
     symmetry of two NPN transistors, replacing the PNP-NPN pair used
     in the bipolar "push-pull" configuration [1-2].
   - Jedec calls totem-pole "a bipolar output" (i.e. TTL/BJT) [3]
   - Jedec claims [3] that "vanilla" tottempole doesn't support
     tristate/hi-Z outputs, making it impossible to connect several such
     circuits in parallel, while we assume the latter to be a hard
     prerequisite for sourcing programmable amounts of current.
   - Some users say that "CMOS outputs are generally push-pull" [4]
   - TI states [5] that the "MOSFET equivalent of the bipolar totempole
     driver [..] is rarely implemented"

Abstracting from the above, I agree that a programmable "drive strength"
is likely achieved by connecting several tristate-capable output
circuits in a "wired OR", as exemplified for Raspberry Pi in [6].

That's true. In the same context of overcoming HS400 issues, our SoC
vendor suggested adjusting the "drive-strength" binding, added in:
 - 7db9af4b6e41be ("pinctrl: add function to parse generic pinconfig
   properties from a dt node")
 - 3caa7d8c3f03ad ("pinctrl: sh-pfc: Add drive strength support")

There _is_ a "drive strength" specific to eMMC device and the
justification for it to exist has been made above.

According to JESD84-B50.1 spec, the host controller is able to find
the "drive strength" values supported by a particular eMMC device by
reading the DRIVER_STRENGTH field of the Extended CSD. The host then
may (if needed), make use of this value to set the "Driver Strength"
parameter in the HS_TIMING field of the Extended CSD register.

Essentially, current series gives the host controller a chance to limit
the drive strength value written to HS_TIMING, if eMMC vendor decides
that some of the values advertised in DRIVER_STRENGTH are forbidden
or should be avoided in a specific bus speed mode (HS200/HS400).

Hopefully clarified above.

JFTR, for these (<HS200) bus speed modes, the eMMC Jedec spec doesn't
talk about changing eMMC's driver strength. That's probably because
there are no signal integrity issues to be fixed in these low-speed
modes.

Below is a quote from JESD84-B50.1 (10.5.4.1 Driver Types Definition):
 -> NOTE: Drive strength definitions are same for 1.8 V signaling level
 -> and for 1.2 V signaling level.

I read the above as:
 -> "the driver strength is independent/agnostic on signaling level"

Not sure I see the linkage between the cause and effect here.
The host cannot infer anything about the supported drive strength values
on eMMC side purely based on the mmc-hs200-*/mmc-hs400-* DT properties.

As explained above, this series allows to customize the eMMC-specific
drive strength. The eMMC vendor did not ask to make the SoC-side
drive strength dependent on bus speed mode and that was not needed in
the testing performed by the customer.

Does this mean that the "fixed-emmc-driver-type" binding which
pre-exists my series falls under the same sentence? Or is this only
when customizing Wolfram's binding to HS200/HS400 bus speed mode?

Note that there is no other objective in this series but to allow Linux
to run on hardware which doesn't strictly follow its specification [7].
If you have any alternative ideas of how to follow the eMMC vendor's
recommendation quoted in the description of this patch, I will happily
review those.

   Due to the difference in N and P carrier mobilities, NPN and PNP
   transistors are never truly symmetric, and there were advantages to
   using NPN. [..] In CMOS logic, the N and P channel drivers are
   symmetric and the driver designs are truly complementary.

   CMOS outputs are generally push-pull. They have a P-channel FET
