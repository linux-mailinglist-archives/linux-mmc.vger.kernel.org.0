Thanks Bjorn for the review. For major comments I'm responding.
Other comments, i will take care of them in my next patch-set.

ios.vdd will be in sync with level. Vdd will be either 0 or a valid 
voltage (3v).

This indirectly gets triggered/invoked through power-irq when driver 
writes 0
or valid voltage to SDHCI_POWER_CONTROL register from 
sdhci_set_power_noreg().

For eMMC case, we don't disable this Vccq2 regulator by having always-on 
flag
in the regulator node. Only for SDcard Vccq2 will be disabled.
Sice driver is common for both eMMC and SDcard, I have to set 0 load to make
it generic and to ensure eMMC Vccq2 regulator will be in LPM mode.

No.sdhci_msm_set_vqmmc handles only vqmmc ON/OFF. While turning it ON it 
sets
Vqmmc to possbile default IO level (1.8v or 3.0v).
Where this is only to make IO lines high (3.0v) or Low (1.8v).

I can use defines. But since these values are different for eMMC and SDcard
I will have to maintain two sets and need to have logic during probe to
identify SDcard or eMMC and use the assign the set accordingly.
So we tought, getting from dt is simpler and clean.
In case Rob didn't agree with dt entries, I will go with this approach.
