Yes, but I would like to try adding a simple retry at the lower frequency as
well and see how well that works.  I will test that tomorrow.

That is only 3.  If the CRC errors are random, then trying more times might
help.

The block driver will try that at some point.  I will see if I can test how
well that works in this case.
