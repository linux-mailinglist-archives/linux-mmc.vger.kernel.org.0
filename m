Seems like an oversight.  eMMC transfer modes are not supported by the SDHCI
specification, and many drivers use SDHCI_QUIRK2_PRESET_VALUE_BROKEN, so it
looks like it has never been noticeable.

The only things that matter are:
1. don't break other drivers
2. do make it work for your driver

So we can't universally enable presets for HS200 and HS400, nor remove
MMC_DDR52, but we can do something to make it work for you.

Is that your requirement? Which driver is it?

The same driver strength continues to be used for HS200 and HS400 i.e.
card->driver_strength

Generally people first want to know what problem you are trying to solve.
