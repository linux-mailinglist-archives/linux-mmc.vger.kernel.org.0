You are right.

But, what I think is bothering me with the approach, is that it looks
like we are starting to add special treatment of a whole bunch of
different commands.

I understand. I would rather see a patch that adds support, explicitly
for this case.

So the commands to unlock/lock, etc, don't have R1B, but can still
cause the card to become busy after the response has been delivered,
right?

As I said, then please add this as an explicit check to do polling,
then I would be happy. :-)

Yeah, that sounds suboptimal, we can do better than that.

Kind regards
