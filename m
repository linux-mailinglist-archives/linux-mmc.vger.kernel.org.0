That's great! Thanks for testing, again!

Yes, I can pick up my patch first. As it's not really fixing a
problem, but rather preparing for your series to work better, I don't
think we need to care about stable backports, at least for now.

If you re-submit before rc1, then just include my patch early in your series.
