Hi Eric,

Thanks for your answer

I've added the second part into the "salt" registers, and I'm still
getting the same result: the test generic/592 fails with a mismatch.

Thanks for the suggestion, however any combination of little/big endian
and natural/reverse order doesn't change the outcome.

Indeed, I somehow missed that you were setting the DUN in
cqhci_crypto_prep_task_desc, and I'm guessing that's where my issue
lies: it doesn't look like there's any field to set the DUN in the
controller, which doesn't make much sense to me.

The documentation is pretty short, but it looks like it might be
inferred from the MMC commands arguments (the Access Mode bit in the MMC
controller, page 517). Would that make sense?

Thanks
Maxime
