This is from the spec:
A Device may be switched between a Sleep state and a Standby state by
SLEEP/AWAKE (CMD5). In the
Sleep state the power consumption of the memory device is minimized.
In this state the memory device
reacts only to the commands RESET (CMD0 with argument of either
0x00000000 or 0xF0F0F0F0 or
H/W reset) and SLEEP/AWAKE (CMD5). All the other commands are ignored
by the memory device.

We don't change VCC and VCCQ during suspend.

The eMMC spec is being violated here by the Micron eMMC device.
Our hardware has worked this way for over 10 years and has never had a
problem with any of the eMMC devices from the major manufacturers
including older and newer Micron eMMC devices.
When I talked to Micron on the phone, one engineer said it was a
firmware bug, but since it was an older chip that it wouldn't be fixed
and that we should use a newer family of Micron eMMC devices.

We use the per card sleep delay.

The problem is that the system is rebooting and it's the hardware that
automatically sends the CMD0/0xf0f0f0f0 because there's no software
running yet. This can't be changed.
