Hi 

sorry I'm a bit late on this.

There is an SCMI regulator driver built on top of SCMIv3.0 Voltage Domain
Protocol, so as long as your SCMI platform firmware support the new VD
protocol you should be able to wire up a generic SCMI regulator in the DT
(as described in the arm,scmi.txt bindings) and then just use the usual
regulator framework ops with such SCMI regulator without the need to add
a custom regulator using custom SMCCC calls).
