According to your above statement, do you mean that the eMMC host
controller does not support the scenario where the data transmission
timeout value required by the eMMC device is greater than the capacity
of the eMMC host hardware data transmission timer? Unless the eMMC host
vendor accepts their eMMC host accepts the use of SW timers in this
case (adding quirks)?

Do you mean that if we disable the hardware timer/timeout interrupt and
use the software timer, the eMMC host controller will not trigger a
completion interrupt? Even before the SW timer expires, the data
transfer between the host and the eMMC device is complete? Is this what
you mean?

This means this quirk is for eMMC host can privode the completion
interrupt in case HW timer is disabled?

Yes, but the eMMC standard does not define the maximum timeout value.
Different eMMC will have different timeout values.

Yes, this is just an example. I have several platforms, they are TI,
NXP, Intel and Qcom. The timeout time of the hardware timer is
different, the greatest one is 1.3s, some are less than 500ms.

Because I don't know what the maximum volume of the real hardware timer
of each host controller is. And different hosts have different timer
capacities. Meanwhile, the eMMC devices have different data
transmission timeout between the different density/series as well.


Would you please confirm your three points above? If they are true, I
agree we cannot disable hardware timers and use SW tiner on some
platforms.

Thanks in advance.
