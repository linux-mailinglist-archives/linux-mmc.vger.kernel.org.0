That shouldn't matter.

The important part is that I/O from userspace gets suspended before
the system_freezable_wq gets frozen, which is what mmc_rescan() runs
from.

When system_freezable_wq is frozen, running works will be synced for
completion. Scheduled works don't get to run until the
system_freezable_wq is unfrozen.

In other words, the behaviour remains the same, except that we are
suspending card detection in mmc_rescan() to a slightly later state.

Did you try out the patch at your side, to see if it resolves your problems?

Kind regards
