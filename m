That would be an option, but I don't quite like that either. I guess
using locked cards isn't that terribly common. So, perhaps we should
simply leave this to be managed entirely by userspace, for now. As
pointed out by Avri too.

We should still be able to power on/off the card during
suspend/resume, which I think is the most important part here.

Let me get back to reviewing the actual code for $subject patch, to
see how we can move this forward then.

Kind regards
