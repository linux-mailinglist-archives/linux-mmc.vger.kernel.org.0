I will defer to you. But it's a bit complicated so I need more time to think
about how to organize these operations.  Therefore, I'll submit PATCH V4
before sd_uhs2_set_ios() being implemented.

Sorry,  I did not understand why uhs2_caps.flag is related to set_ios().
The bit flags are used to indicate current status of UHS2 card:
  - bit 0: MMC_UHS2_SUPPORT
             This flag indicates if current sd card  supports UHS2 mode.
  - bit 1: MMC_UHS2_INITIALIZED
             This flag indicates if current uhs2 sd card  had been initialized.
  - bit 2: MMC_UHS2_2L_HD
             This flag indicates the speed mode of current uhs2 sd card is
             2L-HD mode. The host sets DCMD argument[0] bit 6
             according to this flag. That means this flag was checked in
             every MMC request.
  - bit 3: MMC_UHS2_APP_CMD
             This flag indicates if the current SD_TRAN command is an APP
             command. The host sets DCMD argument[0] bit 14  according to
             this flag.  That means this flag was checked in every MMC
             request.
  - bit 4: MMC_UHS2_SPEED_B
             This flag indicates the speed range of current UHS2 sd card. This
             flag is used only during uhs2 sd card initialization.

I will add a new variable to the struct mmc_host and name it "uhs2_ios".
In UHS2 CCMD/DCMD command packet, DM in TMODE(bit 6 in Argument)
and bit APP(bit 15 in Argument) are set according to MMC_UHS2_2L_HD
and MMC_UHS2_APP_CMD. Hence, I plan to define struct uhs2_ios as:
struct sd_uhs2_ios {
        bool                  is_2L_HD_mode;    /* DM bit in TMODE in UHS2 DCDM
                                                                  *
argument will be set to 1 when
                                                                  *
this field is true. */
        bool                  is_APP_CMD;         /* APP bit in UHS2 CCMD/DCDM
                                                                  *
argument will be set to 1 when
                                                                  *
this field is true. */
        unsigned int     power_delay_ms;    /* waiting for stable power */
};

As for MMC_UHS2_INITIALIZED and MMC_UHS2_SPEED_B, I plan to add a variable
in struct mmc_card and name it "uhs2_state", to keep current UHS2 card states.
struct mmc_card {
        struct mmc_host *host; /* the host this device belongs to */
        [...]
        struct  sd_uhs2_config  uhs2_config;   /* SD UHS-II config */
        u8                                  uhs2_state;     /* SD
UHS-II states */
#define MMC_UHS2_INITIALIZED    BIT(1)
#define MMC_UHS2_SPEED_B        BIT(2)
        [...]
};

Kind regards,
Jason
