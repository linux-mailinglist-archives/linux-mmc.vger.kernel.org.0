With these patches, I still get copious amounts of spam, but at least relevant
to the wifi card now.
Here's a hopefully useful snippet (it's just a lot of these, from what I could see),
from with my patches:

[  154.177276] mmc1: req done (CMD53): 0: 00001000 00000000 00000000 00000000

[  186.707358] mmc1: req done (CMD53): 0: 00001000 00000000 00000000 00000000

[  186.707498] mmc1:     24 bytes transferred: 0

And the one from without is very similar, except I noticed this pattern:
[   85.942269] mmc1: req done (CMD53): 0: 00001000 00000000 00000000 00000000

[   85.942555] mmc1:     4 bytes transferred: 0
[   85.944548] mmc1: req done (CMD53): 0: 00001000 00000000 00000000 00000000
[   85.944581] mmc1:     2 bytes transferred: 0
[   85.944777] mmc1: req done (CMD53): 0: 00001000 00000000 00000000 00000000
[   85.945160] mmc1: req done (CMD53): 0: 00001000 00000000 00000000 00000000
[   85.945187] mmc1:     2 bytes transferred: 0
... occasionally, some of the requests don't have an "[x] bytes transferred: 0".

Hopefully these help.  I can get a capture of the entire log spam and
put it on on pastebin or something, if that would be more useful.
