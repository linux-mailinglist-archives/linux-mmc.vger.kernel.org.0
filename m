Then my (very biased) opinion is:
Anything >1s window between being notified and power-loss a userspace umount/fsync
might be an improvement enough for your case.
Anything <1s window is then so storage-module-implementation specific that
it's hard to draft a solution that actually provides a measurable improvement.
Of course, turning off the SD cache completely is always an option (with drawbacks
like reduced performance and endurance).

Forgot to CC Oleksij before, did it now.
