I agree. This relates to my reply to Greg K-H recently:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CACRpkdajhivkOkZ63v-hr7+6ObhTffYOx5uZP0P-MYvuVnyweA@mail.gmail.com/

The core of the problem is that drivers/of/platform.c is
very simple and has no idea what kind of bus it is populating
with devices from Device Tree. It is just guessing.

For example platform.c contains this:

        dev->dev.coherent_dma_mask = DMA_BIT_MASK(32);
        if (!dev->dev.dma_mask)
                dev->dev.dma_mask = &dev->dev.coherent_dma_mask;

And again part of the problem is that the device tree parser
mostly just create struct platform_device's on the platform bus
and has no real idea about any constraints on the bus where
it will eventually end up after the platform device is probed and
a new device on some other bus has been created.

Assuming that most problematic MMC controllers (in this
case) are probed from device tree (which I suspect,
but IIUC ACPI devices have the same problem),
my idea for a solution is to start to modify the platform.c
parser to be able to populate devices on some buses
directly, without using an intermediate platform device.

Today MMC isn't using a bus for the host controllers,
it is a class device, so I suppose the "real" solution would
be:

1. Move MMC hosts to a bus instead of a class named
   say mmc_bus. If this is OK with the userspace ABI.

2. Make everything necessary from the struct device
    inside struct mmc_host (today called "class_device")
    copied over from the parent and stop referencing
    the struct device *parent field in struct mmc_host
    directly for everything and its dog.

3. Make struct mmc_host and mmc_alloc_host() and
    mmc_add_host()
    be created and called directly from the device tree in some
    way (like a plug-in mechanism to of/platform.c)
    without creating a platform_device that just end
    up as the intermediary parent of the actual device
    in mmc_host.

4. Now we are creating the device directly on the right
   bus and so we can start thinking about filling in the
   right dma_params and dma_mask and dma_coherent_mask
   when instantiating the device on the mmc_bus
   rather than in every (platform_device) driver.

This is no trivial task because the kernel has gone down
the platform device for all stuff in the device tree for
a while. (Copy/paste same resoning for ACPI I'm afraid.)

I suppose people were looking for a simple solution to
this problem but I can only see a really complicated
solution.

Yours,
