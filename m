I agree that there are more commands that according to the specification
should be included in the list. The most obvious ones that I identify are:
CMD26, CMD27, CMD30, CMD46, and CMD47.

But the reason why I added just CMD56 is that I have an easy way to test
this specific command, and which was how I saw the need for this fix.

My suggestion is to separate adding the other commands to one (or more)
separate patch(es), to when there are good test cases for those.

Kind regards
Mårten
