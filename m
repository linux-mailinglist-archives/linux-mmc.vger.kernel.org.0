Hi Ulf,

When ->card_busy() is stubbed for MMC_ERASE command, CMD13 is running in 
loop, for ~66 seconds.
The card status is just 0xe00 here, no errors, just prog state, as 
awaited for CMD38, and READY_FOR_DATA bit not set.
And after those 66 seconds, the status changes to 0x900.
But busyd0 is still set to 1, during the CMD13 and after.
The test continues, with a CMD25, still with busyd0 and DPSM so the IP 
is stuck, and the STOP command is sent (mrq->stop in mmc_mrq_pr_debug).
And here nothing more happens, wait_for_completion() from 
mmc_wait_for_req_done().

In the case where ->card_busy() is used:
As busyd0 is still 1 in the STATUS register, we cannot know if the 
command really finished. And as the DPSM is stuck, we cannot send other 
read command to check what is on the card.

As I said in another thread:
"I've discussed with Ludovic, and it is somewhat related to this patch set:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-mmc/list/?series=186219&state=%2A&archive=both

The STM32 SDMMC IP needs a specific reset procedure when a data timeout 
occurs. If it is hardware, this is managed with the threaded IRQ. But if 
it is a SW polling (if R1B is replaced with R1), there is nothing in 
frameworks that could call this "unstuck" procedure for STM32 variant.
I don't know how this should be handled."

Are there other things I should check?

The main issue here is that we cannot use R1B if timeout > 
mmc->max_busy_timeout, and SW polling won't be able to call our reset 
procedure in case of trouble.

The second patch in the series, changing the MMC_ERASE argument from 
MMC_SECURE_ERASE_ARG to the argument chosen in the framework will then 
compute a timeout lower than mmc->max_busy_timeout, and the test will pass.
But this does not explain why STM32 SDMMC IP doesn't react well to this 
secure argument after it has executed a write test.


Thanks,
Yann
