If the problem is regulator specific, this would be the correct thing to do.

Although, if the problem is pwrseq specific, like that we need a delay
after enabling the clock and asserting the GPIO enable pin for the
WiFi chip, then we have the "post-power-on-delay-ms" of the pwrseq
node to play with instead.
