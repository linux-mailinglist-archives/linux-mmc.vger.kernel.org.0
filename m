Yes indeed that's how that works.
IIUC your hypothesis was "card gets stuck in busy when CMD25 data was sent
with an invalid CRC"? That hypothesis you can now reject. (For open-ended
CMD25 anyway, you can also try CMD23+CMD25 and CMD24 writes).

If the card is in busy it wont accept any new commands, so that's in
line. The only question is why is it stuck in busy? (The spec
mandates maximum busy times, they are sometimes violated by some card
vendors (especially SD cards), but nothing on the order of 10s should be
observed.)
Have you contacted the card vendor about this? I don't see any hint
on wrongdoing of the host here.

Not that I'm aware of.
