Yes, this is how the controller works, the controller needs the clock to 
make the detect logic work.
If we use gpio to implement this card-detect, it works because the GPIO 
controller/clock keeps working.
For the dw_mmc driver support, we should support both kind of implement 
due to the controller has this function,
so this patch is for the card-detect implement by the dwmmc controller, 
the controller need to keep working
- only for sd-card (so not include the "non-removable " device)
- also not disable rpm when "cd-gpios" is used.

For the power consumption, I believe it will increase, but very very 
small, we can't even monitor the change
if we use the normal equipment. The driver should make function works 
first, and then consider the power.

This patch is to make the dwmmc function works without gpio's help in 
dwmmc driver,
  and has no affect to the gpio option, people still able to use gpio to 
do the cd.


Thanks,
