Christoph, thanks for your reply.

SD spec mentions the write-protect switch on SD cards, while uSD cards
doesn't have one. In general, host drivers implement support for it
via a dedicated GPIO line routed to one of the pins in the SD slot.

In this SD controller case, which is based upon PCI, it works a bit
differently, as the state of the write protect pin is managed through
the PCI interface.

If I understand you correctly, you are saying that the controller
should be able to communicate (upwards to the block layer) its known
write protect state for the corresponding NVMe device, during
initialization?

My apologies if the questions sounds silly, but I have limited
knowledge about the NVMe protocol, sorry.

Kind regards
Uffe
