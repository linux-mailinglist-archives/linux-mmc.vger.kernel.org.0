Great, thanks for your input.

Right.

So you mean we should complete the request in the host driver irq
thread context, then issue another request in this context by calling
blk_mq_run_hw_queues()?

Actually not only the mmc_claim_host() will block the MMC request
processing, in this routine, the mmc_blk_part_switch() and
mmc_retune() can also block the request processing. Moreover the part
switching and tuning should be sync operations, and we can not move
them to a work or a thread.

You mean we can dispatch a request directly from
elevator->type->ops.dispatch_request()?  but we still need some helper
functions to check if these requests can be packed (the package
condition), and need to invent new APIs to start a packed request (or
using cqe interfaces, which means we still need to implement some cqe
callbacks).

This is not true, now the blk-mq will allocate some static request
objects (usually the static requests number should be the same with
the hardware queue depth) saved in struct blk_mq_tags. So the
init_request() is used to initialize the static requests when
allocating them, and call exit_request to free the static requests
when freeing the 'struct blk_mq_tags', such as the queue is dead. So
we can not move the DMA management into the init_request/exit_request.
