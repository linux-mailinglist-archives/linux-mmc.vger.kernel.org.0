Thanks for sharing the news, it looks like a useful tool to me!

One thing I wonder though, is why you didn't consider extending
"mmc-utils" with these new cool things instead? In particular, we have
"lsmmc" in there for MMC and SD cards - and since these have a lot in
common with the SDIO cards, I believe it would make sense to extend it
(in some way or the other).

Note that, if you are willing to help with maintenance of mmc-utils
around this, what would certainly be appreciated too. :-)

Kind regards
Uffe
