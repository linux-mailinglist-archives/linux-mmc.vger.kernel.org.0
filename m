Doh! :( I definitely can't say I understand the iommu subsystem
amazingly well. It was working for me, but I could believe that I was
somehow violating a rule somewhere.

I'm having a bit of a hard time understanding where the problem is
though. Is there any chance that you missed the part of my series
where I introduced a "pre_probe" step? Specifically, I see this:

* really_probe() is called w/ a driver and a device.
* -> calls dev->bus->dma_configure() w/ a "struct device *"
* -> eventually calls iommu_probe_device() w/ the device.
* -> calls iommu_alloc_default_domain() w/ the device
* -> calls iommu_group_alloc_default_domain()
* -> always allocates a new domain

...so we always have a "struct device" when a domain is allocated if
that domain is going to be associated with a device.

I will agree that iommu_probe_device() is called before the driver
probe, but unless I missed something it's after the device driver is
loaded.  ...and assuming something like patch #1 in this series looks
OK then iommu_probe_device() will be called after "pre_probe".

So assuming I'm not missing something, I'm not actually relying the
IOMMU getting init off the back of driver probe.

We've never had an initramfs script in Chrome OS. I don't know all the
history of why (I'm trying to check), but I'm nearly certain it was a
conscious decision. Probably it has to do with the fact that we're not
trying to build a generic distribution where a single boot source can
boot a huge variety of hardware. We generally have one kernel for a
class of devices. I believe avoiding the initramfs just keeps things
simpler.

I think trying to revamp Chrome OS to switch to an initramfs type
system would be a pretty big undertaking since (as I understand it)
you can't just run a little command and then return to the normal boot
flow. Once you switch to initramfs you're committing to finding /
setting up the rootfs yourself and on Chrome OS I believe that means a
whole bunch of dm-verity work.


...so probably the initramfs is a no-go for me, but I'm still crossing
my fingers that the pre_probe() might be legit if you take a second
look at it?
