Correct, but it's an improvement in comparison to current state.

Fragile in what sense? Nothing can happen to the card as it is locked.

Everything will simply time-out.

Yes, he did a great work but obviously no-one got too excited to 
review/merge
his work. His solution was complex.

Mine targets the smallest change possible to make it work at least.
I wanted to avoid a solution that would be hard to test, review and 
maintain.
Especially when there is only a small interest in the feature.

I don't think I have the skills to revive his work.
