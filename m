The hardware that I have (sdm630) appears to allow programming and evicting keys
even while CQHCI_CFG.CQHCI_ENABLE is clear, i.e. even when the CQE is "off".
I tested it using the patch below.

The eMMC specification isn't clear about this point.  But I'm thinking that the
crypto configuration registers (the keyslots) are probably supposed to work like
most of the other CQHCI registers, which can be written to while CQHCI_ENABLE is
clear.  Then setting CQHCI_ENABLE just enables the ability to actually issue
requests.  Likewise, setting CQHCI_CRYPTO_GENERAL_ENABLE just allows using
crypto in requests; it isn't needed to write to the crypto configurations.

For what it's worth, UFS crypto (which has been supported by upstream since
v5.9) works similarly.  Keys can be programmed while the UFS host is powered on,
even before it's "enabled".

But maybe someone interpreted the eMMC specification differently.  Hopefully
Mediatek can give some insight into how they implemented it, and test this
patchset on their hardware too.

Here's the patch I used to verify that sdm630 allows programming and evicting
keys even while the CQE is off:
