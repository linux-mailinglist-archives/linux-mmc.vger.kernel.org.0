Can you please point me to the corresponding information in the spec
that states that the above behavior is correct?

In principle what you are saying is that busy signalling on DAT0 is
*entirely* broken, at least for some cards and some commands.

Right. See more comments about this further below.

This has an R1B response, hence we already do the proper polling that is ne=
eded.

In other words, we don't need to explicitly check for this command
here, as we are already checking the response type (R1B) in
__mmc_blk_ioctl_cmd().

What's this used for? It's obsolete, at least in the eMMC spec. Please drop=
 it.

These are already supported via the generic block interface, please
drop the checks.

Let's discuss these, since they have R1 responses.

Although, according to the eMMC spec, the card moves to rcv state, not
the prg state as you refer to in the commit message. Normally, we
don't need to poll for busy/tran completion of these commands.

Have you observed through proper tests that this is actually needed?

> +       case MMC_SET_WRITE_PROT:

The three above have R1B, please drop them from here as they are
already supported correctly.

Again, this has an R1 response and the card moves to rcv state.
Normally we shouldn't need to poll, but I have to admit that the eMMC
spec isn't really clear on what will happen when using the "forced
erase" argument. The spec mentions a 3 minute timeout....

Are these actually being used? If not, please drop them from being
supported. I don't want to encourage crazy operations being issued
from userspace.

Overall, it looks like we need to add a check for MMC_LOCK_UNLOCK to
poll for busy, but that's it, I think.

I don't quite understand what we accomplish with polling for TRAN
state in one case and in the other case, both TRAN and READY_FOR_DATA.
Why can't we always poll for TRAN and READY_FOR_DATA? It should work
for all cases, no?
