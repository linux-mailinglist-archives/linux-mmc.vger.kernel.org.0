For eMMC and their host controllers, changing down modes has often required special support in host controller drivers, with the creation of a number of a callbacks.  UHS-I could be just as problematic.

Some drivers do save and restore the tuning value.  That is definitely worth investigating.

Another possibility is to see whether it is possible to make a version of the switch to 4-bit that is resilient to CRC errors so it still works without tuning.
