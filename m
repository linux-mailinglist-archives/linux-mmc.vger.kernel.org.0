I think so, but let me elaborate a bit.

As I understand it, to initialize the data structures, blk_ksm_init()
is getting called and via cqhci_init().

To hook up the block request queue, blk_ksm_register() is called via
mmc_setup_queue(), which means this happens when the mmc block device
driver is probed.

To free up the data structures, blk_ksm_destroy() is called from
mmc_free_host().

To me, this can be made more consistent. For example, it looks like
blk_ksm_destroy() could be called, even if blk_ksm_init() hasn't been
called (depending on the probe error path of the mmc host).

There are a couple of options to better deal with this.
1) Extend the blk_ksm interface with a devm_blk_ksm_init() function
(thus let it deal with lifecycle problems for us) and simply drop the
call to blk_ksm_destroy().
2) Extend the cqhci interface with a cleanup function (perhaps
"cqhci_deinit") and let it call blk_ksm_destroy().
3) Convert to let blk_ksm_init() to be called from mmc_add_host() and
blk_ksm_destroy() from mmc_remove_host().

Moreover, even if there seems to be no real need to call
blk_ksm_unregister() for the mmc block device driver, perhaps we
should still do it to be consistent with blk_ksm_register()?

Then a final concern. It looks like the mmc core relies on checking
"host->caps2 & MMC_CAP2_CRYPTO", when it calls blk_ksm_register() and
blk_ksm_reprogram_all_keys(), for example. Normally, host->caps2 bits
are considered as static configurations and set during the host driver
probe path, which may not be a good match for this case. Instead, it
seems like we should set a new separate flag, to indicate for the mmc
core that blk_ksm_init has been enabled. Otherwise it looks like we
could end up calling blk_ksm_reprogram_all_keys(), even if
blk_ksm_init() hasn't been called.

Kind regards
Uffe
