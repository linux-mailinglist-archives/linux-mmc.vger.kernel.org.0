Hi Hector,

I see a misunderstanding here :) explaining below.

Hehe. I think we have different ideas of "user-controlled" here,
our "users" include OP-TEE, which develop and deploy a TEE
which is open source.
https://www.op-tee.org/
Joakim who works on this project is on CC he's just not saying
anything (yet).

This project is forked and deployed by different Android and
other Arm SoC-using vendors.

Some vendors have written their own TEE from scratch.

So our users include these guys. :) As in: they take an active
interest in what we are designing here. They have access to
devices where they can replace the whole secure world for
development. They work actively with the kernel and created
the drivers/tee subsystem which is the pipe where the kernel
and the TEE communicate.

The way OP-TEE makes use of RPMB is to call out to a userspace
daemon called tee-supplicant, which issues ioctl()s down to the
eMMC device to read/write counters. AFAIK other TEE implementations
use a similar scheme. (Judging from feedback I got when rewriting
the RPMB code in the MMC subsystem, it mattered to them.)
Their source code is here:
https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_client/blob/master/tee-supplicant/src/rpmb.c

So Linux' eMMC RPMB code is already in wide use for this, it is
what I think all Android phones are actually using to read/write RPMB
counters. It's not like they're accessing RPMB "on the side" or
so. (I might be wrong!)

Since reading/writing RPMB on eMMC needs to be serialized
alongside Linux' read/write commands it is absolutely necessary
that the secure world and the Linux storage drivers cooperate
so the solution is to let Linux handle this arbitration.

Now the question for this patch set is: is TEE software the only
user we need to care about?

Yours,
Linus Walleij
