Just for completeness, on the LS1028A there is definetly one for eMMC
and one for SD card. One supports voltage switching and one has a 8bit
data bus. But as Vladimir already said, this doesn't matter for this
discussion.

No if there was
   &esdhc { status = "disabled" };
this would change the block device from /dev/mmcblk0 to /dev/mmcblk1
for the remaining &esdhc1.

We are going cirlces here. I guess Shawn (as the soc maintainer) has to
step in and decide if a common soc include should contain aliases for
nodes which are disabled. That is what it boils down to.

All other arguments against having aliases in the common include can be
found in this thread.

Nobody argue against having these alias. We are arguing against having
them in the common soc include.
