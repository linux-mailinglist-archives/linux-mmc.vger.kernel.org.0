I haven't had a chance to look at it properly, but I do have a couple of
dumb questions.  How do you ensure the host controller is not runtime
suspended when the key is programmed?  Are the keys lost when the host
controller is reset, and then how do you know the host controller does not
get reset after the key is programmed but before the I/O is submitted?
