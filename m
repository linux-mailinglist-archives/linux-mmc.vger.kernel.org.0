Summary
=======
In these patches we focus on uhs2 side to address Ulf's suggestion which
was mentioned in patch [mmc: core: Preparations to support SD UHS-II cards].


I moved codes in uhs2.c to proper functions in sd_uhs2.c, which should meet 
Ulf's expection.

Please review this series (particularly Patch 29/29).

Thanks.
-Jason Lai

------ original cover letter from v3 ------
This is an interim snapshot of our next version, v4, for enabling
UHS-II on MMC/SD.

It is focused on 'sdhci' side to address Adrian's comments regarding
"modularising" sdhci-uhs2.c.
The whole aim of this version is to get early feedback from Adrian (and
others) on this issue. Without any consensus about the code structure,
it would make little sense to go further ahead on sdhci side.
(Actually, Adrian has made no comments other than "modularising" so far.)

I heavily reworked/refactored sdhci-uhs2.c and re-organised the patch
set to meet what I believe Adrian expects; no UHS-II related code in
Legacy (UHS-I) code or sdhci.c.

Nevertheless, almost of all changes I made are trivial and straightforward
in this direction, and I believe that there is no logic changed since v3
except sdhci_uhs2_irq(), as ops->irq hook, where we must deal with UHS-II
command sequences in addition to UHS-II errors. So I added extra handlings.

I admit that there is plenty of room for improvements (for example,
handling host->flags), but again the focal point here is how sdhci-uhs2.c
should be built as a module.

Please review this series (particularly Patch#8-#26 and #27) from this
viewpoint in the first place.
(Ben is working on 'host' side but there is no change on 'host' side
in this submission except a minor tweak.)

Thanks,
-Takahiro Akashi

Summary
=======
These patches[1] support UHS-II and fix GL9755 UHS-II compatibility.

About UHS-II, roughly deal with the following three parts:
1) A UHS-II detection and initialization:
- Host setup to support UHS-II (Section 3.13.1 Host Controller Setup Sequence
  [2]).
- Detect a UHS-II I/F (Section 3.13.2 Card Interface Detection Sequence[2]).
- In step(9) of Section 3.13.2 in [2], UHS-II initialization is include Section
  3.13.3 UHS-II Card Initialization and Section 3.13.4 UHS-II Setting Register
  Setup Sequence.

2) Send Legacy SD command through SD-TRAN
- Encapsulated SD packets are defined in SD-TRAN in order to ensure Legacy SD
  compatibility and preserve Legacy SD infrastructures (Section 7.1.1 Packet
  Types and Format Overview[3]).
- Host issue a UHS-II CCMD packet or a UHS-II DCMD (Section 3.13.5 UHS-II
  CCMD Packet issuing and Section 3.13.6 UHS-II DCMD Packet issuing[2]).

3) UHS-II Interrupt
- Except for UHS-II error interrupts, most interrupts share the original
  interrupt registers.

Patch structure
===============
patch#1-#7: for core
patch#8-#17: for sdhci
patch#18-#21: for GL9755

Tests
=====
Ran 'dd' command to evaluate the performance:
(SanDisk UHS-II card on GL9755 controller)
                             Read    Write
UHS-II disabled (UHS-I): 88.3MB/s 60.7MB/s
UHS-II enabled         :  206MB/s   80MB/s

TODO
====
- replace some define with BIT macro
