Does this happen if you limit the emmc from going into high speed
modes? (disable hs-200 and hs-400 modes)
I'm curious if it's an issue resuming the emmc at all, or if it's an
issue jumping back into high speed mode.
Depending on if the emmc gets power cycled and how they handle power
management, this can lead to a mode mismatch between the controller
and the emmc.
Also does it eventually sort itself out? For example if rootfs isn't
on the emmc and resume completes, does the emmc eventually become
unwedged?

I haven't started playing with power management on rk3399 yet, but at
least this will help isolate down where the issue is.

Very Respectfully,
Peter Geis
