You seem to have figured that out already with SOC_ID example.
That was quick I must say 😄.

Sure, sorry I didn't express my concern properly. I want to avoid dt bindings
for these and use the SMCCC discovery we have in place already if possible.

If this driver had consumers in the DT and it needs to be represented
in DT, it is a different story and I agree for need for a driver there.
But I don't see one in this usecase.

Spec is out[1], include/linux/arm-smccc.h points to the latest spec.
TF-A does have implementation as I tested with it and even reported
bug that I discovered when I tested with my patches that are now merged
upstream. Are you referring to master of TF-A or last release version ?
If latter, it had bug and may not be working. I may be wrong though, as
I am just telling what was told to me couple of months back and things
might have changed in TF-A land.
