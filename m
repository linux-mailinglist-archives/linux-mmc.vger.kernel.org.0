I have read the reports and browsed the data you provided. It seems
like this is an sdhci-acpi mmc/sd controller, Adrian Hunter (Intel
maintains this variant). There is one eMMC, which seems to work fine
and then the SD-card that you have inserted. The SD card looks like it
gets detected properly.

I don't see anything in the logs that stands out. However, I would try
a couple of different SD-cards, just to see what happens (if you have
more then one at hand). From that and going forward, I think I will
need to defer to Adrian's help. Perhaps we can put together some debug
patch for you to test, or so.

I will keep monitoring the discussion and fold in if there is anything
more I can help with.

Kind regards
Uffe
