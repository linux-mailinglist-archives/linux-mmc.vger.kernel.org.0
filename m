The reboot is kind of a separate problem, even if it's related, isn't it?

What you propose is to add a sysfs node to let userspace
enable/disable CQE. I was under the impression that this was solely to
allow the FFU process to be completed, no?

Are you saying that we may want CQE to stay disabled beyond the FFU
process, to allow the reboot to be completed safely?

Yes, of course. It sounds like you may have misinterpreted my proposals.

The problem is not that we need to claim the host, but that you add an
entirely new path to do it.

*If* we conclude that we should add a sysfs node to control CQE, we
should create a mmc blk request for it (which will manage the claim
for us as well). I suggest you have a closer look at
power_ro_lock_store(), which should be the equivalent to what we need
to implement here.

To be clear, I am not proposing to add a new ioctl for mmc. Those we
have today, should be sufficient I think.

However, rather than adding a new sysfs node to control CQE, perhaps
we can parse the received ioctl data structure, to find out if the
command/request is for FFU and then take specific actions. Along the
lines of what we do for mmc_sanitize(), for example.

Another option, rather than parsing ioctl data for the FFU
command/request, is to always temporarily disable CQE while processing
an mmc ioctl request.

Would this work?

Kind regards
Uffe
