I agree with the above.

Moreover, the stubs make the code more portable/scalable and so it
becomes easier to maintain.

Again, I agree.

Moreover, a "git grep CONFIG_IOMMU_API" indicates that the problem
isn't specific to Tegra. The "#ifdef CONFIG_IOMMU_API" seems to be
sprinkled across the kernel. I think it would be nice if we could
improve the situation. So far, using stubs along with what the
$subject patch proposes, seems to me to be the best approach.
