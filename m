That seems unlikely, the platform device would need to be initialized
via board file and then its of_node assigned somehow. It doesn't make
much sense to me. We either use board file or dtb to instantiate devices.

Yes, the patch looks good. Similar cleanups are already done in most of
the s3c/s5p/exynos drivers.
