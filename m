I can second that. And also keep in mind that the actual supply
voltage must be below that threshold. Thus, the power-off time also
depends on the capacitance on that supply line after the power load
switch. There are switches with dedicated output discharge circuits
built-in.

That being said, from my experience there are cards which will work
when switching back from 1V8 to 3V3 signalling and some don't. I
haven't digged deeper into that topic, though.
