I'm not sure I fully understood the problem you are trying to solve.
I have a device at hand that uses eMMC (and was produced almost ten years ago).
This device has a regular GPT on eMMC and no kernel needs to be patched for that.
So, why is it a problem for the mentioned OEMs to use standard GPT approach?
