Hello Chevron,

Ignoring the errors at the probe stage will get the driver working as=20
well as it did before kernel version 5.12, however, it is still incorrect.
Because, if the read errors are ignored, the values returned in the=20
"scratch_32" variable will be invalid.
Those invalid values are then used to compute a mask that written back=20
to the chip's O2_SD_PLL_SETTING register.

Would it be possible to power the chip at the start of the probe call,=20
so its registers could be properly read?

Alternatively, could one delay the configuration of these registers=20
until after the chip had been properly powered?
(Could one turn on the power in probe, delaying the rest of the=20
initialization until after power had stabilized?)

Note that even when this driver functioned, it required

debug_quirks2=3D4

to disable ultra high-speed support.

Also, note that the PCI_DEVICE_ID_O2_SDS0, SDS1 and FUJIN2
cases of the probe function in version 5.10 ignored the results form readin=
g O2_SD_FUNC_REG0 and O2_SD_FUNC_REG4.
I don't have those chip types to test, but I must assume the results, in th=
ese cases, were ignored for similar reasons.
