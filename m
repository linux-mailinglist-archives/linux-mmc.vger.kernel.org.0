I got an answer form a member of the SD commitee, and the answer is:

"The SD specification define that case very clearly as following.
If card’s access is restricted through one of the SD unique features – PSWD
Lock/Unlock,  Temporary or Permanent WP (TWP or PWP) or CPRM  then if access
attempt is done through its NVMe interface the card will restrict the access
and respond with Access denied.    The access restriction shall be removed
through the SD protocol/interface before being able to access the card through
the NVMe.
That is defined as following in the section 8.1.6  of the SD7.0 onward."

Note that if you look at the spec this means only rejecting NVMe commands
that write dta for the write protect pin.
