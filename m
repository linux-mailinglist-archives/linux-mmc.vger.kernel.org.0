I never thought of biu_clk isn't been provided as it's for accessing
register/fifo/interrupt/DMA requested by dwc databook. I was
suprised it's the optional case for some platforms. What I was thinking
is all based on that defer case.

Yes, if it's optional case for some platforms, we should use
devm_clk_get_optional() instead, both for biu_clk and ciu_clk.
Although I will also be surprised to see ciu_clk is also
optional, the code should be consistent.
