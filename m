In the regular request path (non CQE), we call mmc_blk_card_busy() to
complete a request. For write I/O, this leads to calling
card_busy_detect(), which starts to poll the card by sending a CMD13.

At least one CMD13 will be sent to the card, before we exit the
polling loop and a new I/O request can get submitted. However, in many
cases, depending on the controller/host/card/request-size, my best
guess is that *one* CMD13 might not be sufficient. At least, that is
what I have observed on those platforms I recently have been working
on.

That said, I am wondering if you have done some measurement/profiling
on this particular behaviour for your controller/driver? For example,
how many CMD13 gets sent for random small writes during polling?

Why am I asking this? Because, unless I am mistaken, when using the
new hsq path that you introduce in $subject series, based on the cqe
ops, then mmc_blk_card_busy() is not being called at all. In other
words, you rely on HW busy detection from the controller/driver,
rather than polling with CMD13. Is that correct?

This seems like an additional reason to why you achieve significant
improvements for the random write case. Don't you think?

It would be nice to also have some measurements for an SD card, now
that the series supports this. Is that possible for you test as well?
