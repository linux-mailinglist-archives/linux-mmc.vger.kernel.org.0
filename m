If your hardware has no way to specify a starting DUN (or starting IV) for each
request, then presumably it automatically chooses IVs based on the location of
the data on-disk.

This way of IV generation is problematic for several reasons, and it doesn't
match the UFS and eMMC standards.  So blk-crypto and fscrypt don't support this
type of hardware.
