Let me ask few more questions:

You said that the issue is with a SDIO card. How about eMMC and sdcard,
does the issue occur for them too?

Then you mention "too soon after reset", but add a delay to power-up.
If the delay would be needed after reset, then shouldn't it be in
meson_mmc_probe() after the call to device_reset_optional()?
