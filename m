Not sure I agree with that, sorry.

We may end up having a card half-way initialized that we can't really
communicate with in a stable manner. From a system point of view, I
would be worried.

I would rather just power off the card if initialization fails and
remove its corresponding device from the system.

Yes, but it's uncertain what that could lead to?

What will happen with power consumption and power management support,
for example.

It's quite some amount of code. On the other hand, it seemed quite
straight forward, not that complex to me.

I see, maybe we should ping Al and other interested folkz to see if
there still is some interest to move this forward?
