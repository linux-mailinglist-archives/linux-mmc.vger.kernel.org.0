Correct.

Yep, I definitely tend to agree with you here. Thanks for doing the
test and sharing the result.

Right, but see more below.

In fact, we have a few rare corner cases that can trigger KASAN splats
when mmc_remove_host() gets executed. Similar splats can be triggered
by just doing a sudden card removal. It's especially related to the
cases, where a thread holds a reference to the card/host object when
it's being removed. I am working on patches to fix these cases, but
haven't yet decided on the best solution.

That's the reason why I was thinking that maybe returning
-EPROBE_DEFER could be an option, but certainly I need to think more
about this.

No worries, thanks a lot for sharing your thoughts!
