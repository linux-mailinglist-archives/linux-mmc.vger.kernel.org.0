Ah, got it.  Maybe mention this in the bindings?  Like "Optional, CQE
is only implemented on controllers meant for eMMC and version v4.2 and
above"

Oh, also s/cpre/core

Ah.  I think I got confused!  When I saw "msm-v4 and below" in the
description of "SD Core register map", I assumed that means that
"v4.2" didn't have it.  Maybe would be less confusing to change to:

- SD Core register map (required for controllers earlier than msm-v5)

Then I think what you have can be fine.

OK.  You've convinced me.  It's still up to Rob but it seems like you
have a good justification now that I understand it better..  ;-)

I think you could send out a v2 with the small wording changes and
maybe it would be landable, but you'd want to follow up rather soon
with the yaml conversion.
