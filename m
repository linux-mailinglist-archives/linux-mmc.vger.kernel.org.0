I have managed to reproduce the problem!  Wow, I wonder how this could
have slipped through without anybody reporting about this, until now.
So, thanks for bringing this to my attention!

My rough guess is that SD cards, used in these kinds of configurations
(Android), are actually set to non removable. This would prevent
mmc_rescan() from claiming the host.

In any case, this needs to be fixed properly. I will continue to work
on a solution and get back to you with a patch.

Kind regards
