Let me describe what happens (sorry for bad English, I'm self taught).

This never happens with external mmc.

This happens only with internal emmc and only after resume from suspend
to ram if the internal emmc mounted or the machine is booted with emmc
only.

This happens on random time after resume, sometimes after 5-10 minutes,
sometimes hours and sometimes even after day or two.

Never happens if the machine isn't suspended to ram.

Could you tel me how can I disable these modes (I'm not kernel hacker).

No, if the rootds is on emmc after some time when this happens trying to
run any command they segfaults.
