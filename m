Because he sketches maximum flexibility here. Have a non-HS (default)
value, one for HS200, and one for HS400:

	fixed-emmc-driver-type =3D <[default] [HS200] [HS400]>;

'-1' sounds good to me, too.

What I have seen so far: setting drive strength alone is more on the
rare side. Setting specific values for default and HS200/400 seems even
more rare to me. With this patchset, it is the first time I hear about
it.

Yet, my experience might be a bit limited, maybe others (Hi Ulf! ;)) can add
their views, too?

Regards,
