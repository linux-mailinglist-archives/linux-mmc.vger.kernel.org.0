On qcom platforms, only SDHC instance meant for eMMC has the CQE support.
So mentioned that its needed only for eMMC.

core_mem is present till <v5.0
cqhci_mem is present on >=v4.2
Say, for version v4.2 both are present; .... and for v5.0 only cqhci_mem 
is present.

Both hc reg-map and core reg-map are being accessed through index.
So no need to list the reg names 'hc_mem' & 'core_mem' in general.

But coming to cqhci reg-map we can't access it with fixed index, since 
its index varies between 1/2
based on controller version.

So we are accessing it through reg-names. Since reg-names has to be 
associated with corresponding
reg maps, other two reg-names (hc_mem & core_mem) also need to br listed 
when cqhci_mem is listed.

That is the reason, I mentioned it like these are needed only cqe reg 
map is supplied.
If it is creating confusion, i will remove that statement.

Sure. Its the same reason mentioned in above comment.
