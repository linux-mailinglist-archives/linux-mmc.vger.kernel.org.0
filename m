Yes the device from:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202459

Seems to be the exact same one as the one where I'm seeing this problem
and presumably the fix I wrote should work for that one too.

As discussed I still need to try an alternative fix. I hope to get around
to that sometimes during the coming 2-3 days.

Regards,

Hans
