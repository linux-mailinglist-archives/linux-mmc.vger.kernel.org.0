I have cards that fail 100% on my RZ//G2M.  I have an N and H as well,
but I haven't tested them yet.

Unfortunately, a colleague of mine tested positive for covid-19, which
prompted several of us to get tests, and I received a positive test,
so I cannot go back to the office for at least 5 days.  (I am feeling
fine today)
Because I cannot go into the office I can't get the exact part number,
but the card I have is a Patriot card, but a colleague of mine
reported another brand was failing the same way.

I was given permission to ship one out if you're interested but I have
to wait until next week to test anything or ship anything. Please
don't feel obligated to accept the card,but I know it can be easier to
have actual hardware.

Thanks for responding.  I'll try to get card info / part number from
my colleague.
