Hi, I want to report a bug related to the drivers of the sd card
reader Broadcom Broadcom Corporation BCM57765/57785 SDXC/MMC Card
Reader. Basically It doesn't show the inserted cards, and even though
it has a workaround that has worked flawless for mac users, many acer
user seem to have problems like not being able to transfer large files
(larger than a couple or not being able to format the card. I know
this has been reported before but it keeps having problems. Thanks for
your help, here are some links to previous reports of this bug and
previous attempts to solve this issue. I experience this bug on a
laptop acer v5-131 with said sd card reader running elementary 5.1.7
Hera but I've encountered this same bug on all other ubuntu flavors on
this same device. All using Kernel 5.4

Please, if I'm doing something wrong by trying to report this bug,
please let me know
