Overall, I like this approach of separating UHS2 from legacy sdhci as much
as possible.  The only major change, is to drop support for legacy quirks
and features that you do not need.  The reason for that, is that there may
be few drivers that end up with UHS-II support (opting instead for SD
Express), so there is no point going to a lot of trouble to support things
that never get used.

From what I have seen that looks like it includes:
	- any quirks
	- SDHCI LED support
	- external DMA support
In this regard, the important thing is to have a comment somewhere that
lists what is not supported.

I have only looked at SDHCI patches so far, and only up to about patch 20,
but maybe that gives you enough to go on for a while.
