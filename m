As I have probably indicated earlier, I am starting to become more and
more annoyed with these arm_smccc_smc() calls in generic drivers.

As a matter of fact, I think the situation is about to explode. Just
do a "git grep arm_smccc_smc" and you will find that it's not only SoC
specific drivers that call them. In general we want to keep drivers
portable and this is clearly moving in the wrong direction. Or maybe
it's just me being grumpy and having a bad day. :-)

In the Qcom mmc case (drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-msm.c) for eMMC inline
encryption, the arm_smccc_smc() call is slightly better handled as
it's abstracted behind a Qcom specific firmware API. So, sdhci-msm.c
calls qcom_scm_ice_set_key() (implemented in
drivers/firmware/qcom_scm.c) to program a key. I guess we don't have
an abstraction layer that would fit for this case, right?

My point is, when there is no proper abstraction layer to use for the
relevant arm_smccc_smc() call, the Qcom way is fine to me.

In this Mediatek case, it looks slightly different. To me it looks
more like a resource that needs to be turned on/off to enable/disable
the "inline encryption engine". Could it be modeled as phy,
power-rail, clock, pinctrl or perhaps behind a PM domain (where SoC
specific calls makes perfect sense).

Peng can you please elaborate on what goes on behind the
arm_smccc_smc() call, as that would help us to understand what
abstraction layer to pick?

Kind regards
Uffe
