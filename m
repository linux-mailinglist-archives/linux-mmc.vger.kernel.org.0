Well, the call to blk_ksm_register() happens in mmc_crypto_setup_queue(), when
allocating the request_queue for a particular mmc_card.  As far as I can tell,
the mmc_host has already been initialized and added then, so we don't have to
worry about cases where the mmc_host has only been partially initialized.
And in particular, MMC_CAP2_CRYPTO will have its final value.

blk_ksm_destroy() is a no-op on an all-zeroed struct, so it's fine to call it
unnecessarily.  We could call it unconditionally, if that would be clearer.

This would require adding APIs to devm to support zeroing buffers on free and to
use kvmalloc() instead of kmalloc().  It looks like these new APIs wouldn't be
useful for many drivers (since almost everyone else just wants regular kmalloc
with no special behavior on free), so they don't seem worth adding yet.

The blk_keyslot_manager is part of struct mmc_host, so it makes more sense for
mmc_core to be responsible for freeing it.

We could move it to cqhci_host, but that would require adding multiple new
function pointers to mmc_cqe_ops for use by mmc_crypto_set_initial_state(),
mmc_crypto_free_host(), and mmc_crypto_setup_queue(), as these all currently
need access to the blk_keyslot_manager.

I think that making mmc_core directly aware of the blk_keyslot_manager is the
right call, as it avoids excessive callbacks, and it avoids tying the inline
encryption support too closely to CQHCI.  (Keep in mind that in the future, MMC
hosts could support inline encryption using other interfaces besides CQHCI.)

That won't work because the driver has to fill in the crypto capabilities in the
blk_keyslot_manager after calling blk_ksm_init().  mmc_add_host() is too late to
do that.  mmc_add_host() happens after the driver has already initialized the
host structures and is finally registering them with the driver model.

blk_ksm_unregister() isn't exported to modules.  Its only purpose is for the
block layer to disable inline encryption support on a disk if blk-integrity
support is registered on the same disk.  So it shouldn't (and can't) be called
by drivers.

We probably should just remove blk_ksm_unregister() and make
blk_integrity_register() set the ->ksm pointer to NULL directly.  Also maybe
blk_ksm_register() should be renamed to something like
"queue_set_keyslot_manager()" to avoid implying that "unregister" is needed.

However those would be block layer changes, not related to this patchset.

MMC_CAP2_CRYPTO *is* a static configuration that is set during the host driver
probe path.  So I don't understand your concern here.

It's true that during the host driver probe path, MMC_CAP2_CRYPTO initially
means "the hardware might support crypto", and then cqhci_crypto_init() clears
it if it decides that the hardware doesn't support crypto after all, after which
the bit really does mean "the hardware supports crypto".

That seems fine because this all happens while the host structures are being
initialized, before they are registered with the driver model and MMC cards are
detected.  So AFAICS there can't be any concurrent calls to
mmc_crypto_set_initial_state() or mmc_crypto_setup_queue().  Do you think
otherwise?
