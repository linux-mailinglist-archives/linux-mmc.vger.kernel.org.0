I only tested the meson-mx-sdio driver with eMMC once (a long time
ago) and it did not work.
...maybe this is the reason ;)

SD cards and SDIO cards are the main use-case for this driver.
I don't know of any board which connects this controller to a card
with 1.8V (or 1.8V/3.3V configurable) I/O voltage. This is why I
didn't care about ->start_signal_voltage_switch() so far

I'll let future Martin deal with that - he can add it back as needed ;-)
current Martin has his doubts that it'll be needed (see above)

thank you for double-checking!

agreed, I will send a v2 later which adds the Fixes tag, a bit more
description and an additional patch to remove ->card_busy()


Thank you again very much for the insights!
Have a great day,
Martin
