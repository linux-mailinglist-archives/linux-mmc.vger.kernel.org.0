Hi,

The issue occurs in  mmc_set_uhs_voltage(), when calling 
host->ops->card_busy(), which is mmci_card_busy() for this driver.
It is expected here to return busy after the SD_SWITCH_VOLTAGE (CMD11),
but host->busy_state = 0 in mmci_card_busy(), so it return 0.

A possible correction, but that may break what you've done, could be:

diff --git a/drivers/mmc/host/mmci.c b/drivers/mmc/host/mmci.c
index 3ff6655a56d1..006fd84090ac 100644
--- a/drivers/mmc/host/mmci.c
+++ b/drivers/mmc/host/mmci.c
@@ -340,13 +340,10 @@ static int mmci_card_busy(struct mmc_host *mmc)
         unsigned long flags;
         int busy = 0;

-       if (host->ops->busy_complete) {
-               if ((host->busy_state == MMCI_BUSY_IDLE) ||
-                   (host->busy_state == MMCI_BUSY_DONE))
-                       return 0;
-               else
-                       return 1;
-       }
+       if (host->ops->busy_complete &&
+           host->busy_state != MMCI_BUSY_IDLE &&
+           host->busy_state != MMCI_BUSY_DONE)
+               return 1;

         spin_lock_irqsave(&host->lock, flags);


The SD-card is now properly detected (and in SDR104 mode) on STM32MP13 
board.


Best regards,
Yann
