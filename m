Hi Ulf! My apologies for the delay.

Yes, we have a userspace program. So if the userspace program will try to
restore the card in a situation such as the one we are trying to solve
here, how shall it perform it? Is it expected that a ioctl CMD0 request
should be enough, or is there any other support for a userspace program to
reset the card?

If it falls on a ioctl command to reset the card, how do we handle the case
where the ioctl times out anyway? Or is the only way for a userspace program
to restore the card, to make a block transfer that fails?

Kind regards
