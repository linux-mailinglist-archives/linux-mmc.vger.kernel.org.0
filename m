This is expensive I think, now not all SD host controllers or cards
can handle batching request, only for those which can support ADMA3 or
packed command.

I do not think that the switch command can be batched together with
the normal command. We must wait for the completion of the switch
command before sending the normal command. It should be the SYNC
command in MMC stack.

I think the first method suggested by Arnd can work.

The on-stack plugging is enabled in my case, and from the commit
message of introducing this structure, the ->last flag is used to
indicate the last request in the chain, but seems work abnormally.

"Since we have the notion of a 'last' request in a chain, we can use
    this to have the hardware optimize the issuing of requests. Add
    a list_head parameter to queue_rq that the driver can use to
    temporarily store hw commands for issue when 'last' is true. If we
    are doing a chain of requests, pass in a NULL list for the first
    request to force issue of that immediately, then batch the remainder
    for deferred issue until the last request has been sent."

How about Arnd's suggestion? looks reasonable to me that we can have a
new API to handle batching request.

OK.

Yes, I've looked at the dasd.c driver, and it used a list to link
requests from blk-mq and handled them with a tasklet, but if this will
cause a long latency if we linked more requests into the list and
dispatched them to the controller slowly?

Thanks for your input.
