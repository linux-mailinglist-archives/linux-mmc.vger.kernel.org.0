Why? It should be user's decision. Pretty much in the same way as it's
done for all other keys.

Yes, extracting the payload is fine. As you wrote, dm-crypt and fscrypt
already do it in this way. But what I really don't like here is the idea
of having two different kinds of API having pretty close functionality.
In my opinion, all the keys should be handled via the existing keyrings
API and then imported via the BLKCRYPTOIMPORTKEY IOCTL. This way all
kinds of keys are handled in a similar way from user's point of view.

Hmm. This is typical to have resource-limited capabilities. So yes, the
user checks the capabilities to identify whether the key type is
supported at all. But then _using_ the key might fail. For example
because all the hardware resources that are used by this key type are
already taken.

If AOSP misbehaves, it doesn't mean that we should follow the pattern.
