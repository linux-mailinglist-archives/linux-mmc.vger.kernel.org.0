Oh this might also be because I've cited from the wrong place, namely 
the
mmc_init_card() function. But what I really meant was the sd card 
equivalent
which should be mmc_read_ssr(). Sorry.

	discard_support = UNSTUFF_BITS(resp, 313 - 288, 1);
	card->erase_arg = (card->scr.sda_specx && discard_support) ?
			    SD_DISCARD_ARG : SD_ERASE_ARG;

Do we really need to map these functions? What if we don't have an
actual discard, but just a slow erase (I'm now assuming that erase
will likely be slow on sdcards)? Can't we just tell the user space
there is no discard? Like on a normal HDD? I really don't know the
implications, seems like mmc_erase() is just there for the linux
discard feature.

Coming from the user space side. Does mkfs.ext4 assumes its pre-discard
is fast? I'd think so, right? I'd presume it was intented to tell the
FTL of the block device, "hey these blocks are unused, you can do some
wear leveling with them".

I'm just about finding some SD cards and looking how they behave timing
wise and what they report they support (ie. erase or discard). Looks
like other cards are doing better. But I'd have to find out if they
support the discard (mine doesn't) and if they are slow too if I force
them to use the normal erase.
