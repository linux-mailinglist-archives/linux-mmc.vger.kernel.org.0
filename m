I defer that question to Adrian.

> 2. In block.c, CMD12 uses R1 response for data reading and R1B response for writing. Is it ok to use R1 response for SD? The SD spec mentions only R1B response for CMD12.

I think the specs isn't that clear on this. In this case, the R1B, is
an R1 with an *optional* busy signaling on DAT0, unless it has been
changed lately.

Additionally, as far as can tell, there have been no reports about
problems with the current approach for "reads". Are you saying there
is?
