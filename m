Ok. Can you share the KASAN reports? The memory allocated for this class
object and associated index from the IDA will be unique for each call
the mmc_alloc_host() so I don't see how KASAN could be noticing
something unless a reference to the host is leaking out without the
proper get_device() call being made to keep the underlying memory from
being freed.

I was hoping that you wouldn't need to think more about returning
-EPROBE_DEFER after my email. :( Returning EPROBE_DEFER looks like it's
a bandaid for bigger problems with reference counting the pointer
allocated in mmc_alloc_host(). I hope I convinced you that there isn't
any danger in reusing the IDA in the case of an alias because the only
way that is a problem is if the same device calls mmc_alloc_host() twice
without calling mmc_remove_host() in between. That should be a pretty
obvious problem in driver code? The check to see if that same device has
tried to alloc a host twice would still effectively happen after this
patch because when mmc_add_host() tries to add that second device to the
driver core it will complain about duplicate device names and fail.

Will you apply this patch?
