Which is more or less the direct equivalent of of_dma_is_coherent(), 
just with an extra state and rather different-looking inheritance logic.

(note that the third state is moot anyway because it will actively 
prevent the driver from doing DMA API operations - see dma_dummy_ops)

It is indeed entirely possible to have an inherently non-coherent device 
translated by a coherent SMMU - see the USB controller in your Juno, for 
example - however in terms of these firmware properties those 
coherencies are orthogonal; the latter only describes the SMMU's 
pagetable walk interface, not the path(s) through its translation 
interface(s) which aren't even necessarily all equal.

This can't ever happen because SMMUs aren't represented in the ACPI 
namespace at all. And even if they were, such a topology would still be 
as bogus as it would be in DT - physically, it's perfectly possible for 
a single "device" like a PCI host bridge to have different sets of 
requester IDs translated by different SMMUs, so treating the SMMU as a 
hierarchical "bus" just doesn't work.

This would be a tautology given where dev->dma_coherent comes from in 
the first place - see {platform,pci}_dma_configure().

In terms of DMA API coherency, unless you're working on the SMMU drivers 
you can consider IORT entirely irrelevant and just treat _CCA for 
namespace devices as the first and last word. Yes, technically IORT can 
describe weird stuff with the CPM attribute, but I have every intention 
to keep ignoring that in Linux.
