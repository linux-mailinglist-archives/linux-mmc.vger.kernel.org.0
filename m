CRC is appended by hardware, so it will always be correct.
What you can do though is change the blocksize of the transfer on the
host side (e.g. from 512 to 514 bytes) without changing it using CMD16.
The 2 bytes will be latched in as CRC by the card. Of course you won't
see the CRC ACK from the card in that case (as it clashes with the
hardware CRC signal from the host). 
You can do all this using the ioctl interface in userspace btw.
