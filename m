Thanks for the feedback.

When I think about it, it seems that an error should be returned from the mmc_card_removed() function when the SD card is removed.
However, in my current board, no error is returned from mmc_card_removed().

I'm guessing it's because of the NULL in the mmc_sd_remove() function in drivers/mmc/core/sd.c , but I'm not sure.
I think it was clumsy because I was a newbie unfamiliar with mmc drivers. :)
I'll take a closer look.

Regards,
Kwon
