Making it work in more places sounds good.

Extremely negligible. Basically the only place you shouldn't call
add_device_randomness() is from a hard IRQ handler, but other than
that, go wild. It's actually used all over the boot sequence pretty
liberally.

Grep around a bit and you'll see all the odd drivers it's called from.
And perhaps in the process you'll notice a few other places that might
benefit from calling it. In general, if you have a strong sense of
niche hardware things where you notice that a certain identifier or
field is "probably quasi-unique-ish", an initiative like the one Linus
took with this patch seems like a positive thing to me.

Jason
