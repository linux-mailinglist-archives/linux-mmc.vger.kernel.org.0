Let me try one more time.

The code that is needed to put the GL9763e HW into low power state
(writing to GL9763e specific register) certainly belongs in the
driver.

The code that monitors for a specific use case does not.

I haven't said implementation need to be easy, but suggest a few
options to move forward.

What did state and I am not going to change my opinion on this, is the
governor code that monitors for use cases, don't belong in the driver.

Kind regards
