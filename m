Okay, so digging in to the edk2-platforms code at:

https://source.codeaurora.org/external/qoriq/qoriq-components/edk2-platforms/

I find this:

20 Scope(_SB)
21 {
22   Device(SDC0) {
23     Name(_HID, "NXP0003")
24     Name(_CID, "PNP0D40")
25     Name(_CCA, 0)
...
50   Device(SDC1) {
51     Name(_HID, "NXP0003")
52     Name(_CID, "PNP0D40")
53     Name(_CCA, 0)

So, ACPI describes these devices as DMA _non-coherent_.

The AcpiTables.inf file has:

35  /* Iort.asl
...

So, my understanding is that as there is no IORT, the DMA API will
consider ACPI devices to be non-coherent, and will do cache maintenance
and for dma_alloc_coherent(), will remap memory uncached.

So, it seems that given the current ACPI description, DMA snooping
must *not* be enabled for the eSDHC controller.

Checking the SATA situation:

20 Scope(_SB)
21 {
22   Device(SAT0) {
23     Name(_HID, "NXP0004")
24     Name(_CCA, 1)

So, ACPI is saying that the device _is_ DMA coherent, but given the
lack of IORT, the DMA API will treat this as DMA non-coherent.  I don't
have the knowledge to know what the SATA driver does, whether the SATA
hardware is coherent or not, or whether it contains a bit to control
it, but this basically looks wrong to me given what I understand so
far.

From what I can gather, _CCA must not be explicitly set to 1 or
allowed to default to 1 on ARM64 for any ACPI device without an IORT
table being present to tell the DMA API that the ACPI devices are
coherent.
