I think the original ->set_ios() callback should have been "int"
rather than void. It's clear that those callbacks can actually fail,
but today there is no way for them to report an error.

Therefore, please use 'int'.

I don't mind that we add a few callbacks to support UHS-II, but at the
same time it gets silly to have one for each and every operation.

That said, I think the above approach that you suggest is worth a try.
Let's see what this can bring us to.

I would appreciate it, if you can amend my original patch to fix my mistakes.

As stated, seems reasonable, let's give it a try!

I don't think it's going to play well for existing mmc host drivers to
use the current host->ios.*.

Let's try to add a new host->ios_uhs2.* and add the data we need for
UHS-II in there.

Great!

If you need some additional guidance at this point, just ask.
Otherwise I will defer to review your next version of the series.

Kind regards
