Hi ulf,

We already have AGGRESSIVE_PM enabled for all our internal targets and 
they are in production for quite long time (5-6 years) and haven't seen 
and performance degradations due to garbage collection. Also wear tears 
are not observed as per my current observations so far.

Like you rightly mentioned we may have battery powered devices where 
this caps will be useful and on the other hand we have always powered 
devices where this caps may not be needed, so can we make device tree 
changes and enable this PM property per board selectively?

Also I see there are four below vendor files who have already enabled 
this caps in their vendor file.

sdhci-pci-core.c sdhci-omap.c sdhci-acpi.c rtsx_pci_sdmmc.c

Let me know how can we proceed.

Regards,
Sarthak
