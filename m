Hi Adnrew,

I was wondering if I should wait for Joel's comment, or

1. Drop this patch in this patch series, and prepare another patch
series for this issue in the future. Since sdhci works well as long as we
don't use DMA engine before kernel stage.

2. Modify the reset control according to Philipp and your comment.

Thanks and look forward to having your suggestion.
