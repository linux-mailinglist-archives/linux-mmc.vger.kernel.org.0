Did you test system suspend/resume, while also having an ongoing
file/dd operations towards the mmc/sd card?

In any case, I am aware of the consensus - it looks promising. More
importantly, I appreciate the work you are doing here. Don't get me
wrong on that, even if I am causing these long an unacceptable delays
- sorry about that!

I have spent most of my reviewing time this week, looking at your
series, but it's not a trivial review and I want to take my time to
review it thoroughly. And fore sure, I fully respects Arnd and Adrian
reviews that is made already.

That said, I am sorry to disappoint you, but I am just not ready to
apply it yet.

In regards to the holidays, don't worry, I will be working. Well,
except for those days that are public holidays in Sweden. :-)

To help you out a bit in regards to this, I have hosted a separate
branch in my git tree that have the series applied (based on today's
"next" branch). The branch is namned "next_host_sq". I may decide to
merge it to next, to get some test coverage, but let's see about that.

In any case, feel free to base AMDA3 (packed command) support on the
new branch, at least for now.

Kind regards
Uffe
