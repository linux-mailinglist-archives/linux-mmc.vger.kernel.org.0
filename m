Is there a parent device that has runtime PM enabled?

In other cases, it should be fine to use pm_runtime_set_active()
during ->probe().

I certainly agree. The parent should not be managed directly by the
sdhci driver.

One thing that can be discussed though, is whether
pm_runtime_set_active() actually should runtime resume the parent,
which would make the behaviour consistent with how suppliers are being
treated.

I can try to draft a patch, if that would help? But, let's finalize
the discussion above first (apologize for the delay).

Kind regards
