Hi Linus,

Thanks for the advice.

It is more the opposite.
We had that patch in our downstream for a while, and this was possible 
due to changes in wifi driver.
But I'll check all that precisely, and make some more tests.

OK, I'll do that, in mmci.c file, keeping the possibility to have the DT 
property set even for stm32 variant.
