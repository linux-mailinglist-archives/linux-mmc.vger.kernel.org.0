I have some hypothesis but that isn't even worth sharing, see below.

My answer is simple but not very satisfying:
It is out of spec.
After the CMD11 UHS voltage switch anything on CMD, DAT and CLK you
drive from the host at 3.3V without a proper powercycle is out of spec,
the card's behavior isn't covered by the SD spec and the card isn't to
blame.

If you want a really detailed answer try asking your SD card vendor,
my guess would be their answer is "the host is out of spec".

Kind Regards,
Christian
