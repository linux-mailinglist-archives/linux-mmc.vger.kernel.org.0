After some investigation and offline discussion with you, I still have
some concerns about your suggestion.

1) Now blk-mq have not supplied some ops to prepare a request, which is
used to do some DMA management asynchronously. But yes, we can
introduce new ops for blk-mq. But there are still some remaining
preparation in mmc_mq_queue_rq(), like mmc part switch. For software
queue, we can prepare a request totally after issuing one.

2) I wonder if it is appropriate that using the irq threaded context
to dispatch next request, actually we will still introduce a context
switch here. Now we will complete a request in the hard irq handler
and kick the softirq to do time-consuming operations, like DMA
unmapping , and will start next request in the hard irq handler
without context switch. Moreover if we remove the BLK_MQ_F_BLOCKING in
future like you suggested, then we can remove all context switch. And
I think we can dispatch next request in the softirq context (actually
the CQE already did).

3) For packed request support, I did not see an example that block
driver can dispatch a request from the IO scheduler in queue_rq() and
no APIs supported from blk-mq. And we do not know where can dispatch a
request in queue_rq(), from IO scheduler? from ctx? or from
hctx->dispatch list? and if this request can not be passed to host
now, how to do it? Seems lots of complicated things.

Moreover, we still need some interfaces for the packed request
handling, from previous discussion, we still need something like MMC
software queue based on  the CQE to help to handle the packed request.

So I think I still need to introduce the MMC software queue, on the one
hand is that it can really improve the performance from fio data and
avoid a long latency, on the other hand we can expand it to support
packed request easily in future. Thanks.

(Anyway I will still post the V7 to address Adrian's comments and to
see if we can get a consensus there).
