Ah ok, thanks for the explanation.

Yeah, it makes sense now.

One thing I noticed when playing with some hardware is that during
suspend, when MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY isn't set and we have a
card_busy() implementation, we don't seem to be using card_busy() op
and just always using the timeout from S_A_TIMEOUT. To be more
specific, I'm talking about this code path:
_mmc_suspend() -> mmc_sleep() -> mmc_delay() -> msleep()

I'd think card_busy() could be used here if it's implemented. Is there
a reason for not using it in this path?

Yes, it does. Much appreciated!

Thanks,
