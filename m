I was able to reproduce the issue on sdhci-omap with your patch applied.

In our case, the dat0 line never comes back up when trying to send a
CMD6 with R1. It needs an R1b to work properly. I also set
mmc->max_busy_timeout to 0 and that made it work as well.

I wanna try it out with other R1b commands like erase to see if it works
properly if the delay is actually very long.

Thanks,
Faiz
