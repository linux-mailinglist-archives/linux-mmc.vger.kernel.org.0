I have, but I am not picking it up in its current form.

Yes, but not for all cases, as I said in my reply in those email-threads.

What I had in mind, is that I I think we should inform
mmc_hs400_to_hs200() about under what situation it's getting called.
Depending on that, we should either decrease the clock rate before or
after we send the CMD6.

Would that work for your case?

Kind regards
