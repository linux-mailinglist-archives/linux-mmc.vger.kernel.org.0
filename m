This is just how the pre-existing "iommu.strict=0" command line parameter works.

This is a pre-existing concept in the kernel and is in fact so
prevalent that there are a bunch of inconsistent ways to configure it
(though it's being made better [1])

* On ARM64, default is strict and you can configure it with iommu.strict

* On AMD, default is non-strict and you can configure it with
amd_iommu=fullflush

* On Intel, default is non-strict and you can configure it with
intel_iommu=strict

...also pre-existing is that the kernel has special cases for
"external" PCI devices where it forces them to strict mode even if the
default is non-strict (like on Intel and AMD). I was pointed
specifically at <http://thunderclap.io/> for an example of why this
was important.

This one would be possible to workaround in the driver by copying the
memory somewhere else, but it violates the DMA model. Specifically
step "e)" above is supposed to mean that the driver is now in full
control of the memory, so it should be perfectly justified in assuming
that nobody else is scribbling on it.

"flush" means force / wait for the IOMMU unmap to fully take effect.

The normal Linux memory pool.

Someone else that wanted memory.

Depends on who got it. This could be hard to predict unless a
peripheral was trying to exploit a very specific version of Linux
where maybe it was predictable who got the memory next.

The whole concept of strict vs. non-strict is definitely not new to my
series and I'm mostly just trying to configure it properly.

Right. As discussed in the cover letter, I'm going to try to solve
this in other ways that doesn't involve pre_probe.
