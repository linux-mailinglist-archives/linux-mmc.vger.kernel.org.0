Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] Hi folks,

Hi folks,

This short series adds a few quirks needed to make the card readers in
Apple M1 Pro/Max MacBook laptops work properly.

The first patch should be straightforward; it just allows configuring
the CD/WP polarity based on device tree settings. There is already a
standard DT binding for this.

The second patch works around an issue with 8/16-bit MMIO reads that
only affects these platforms, for some reason.

Changes since v1:

- Also applied workaround to GL9750
- Fixed checkpatch warnings

Hector Martin (2):
  mmc: sdhci-pci-gli: GL9755: Support for CD/WP inversion on OF
    platforms
  mmc: sdhci-pci-gli: GL975[50]: Issue 8/16-bit MMIO reads as 32-bit
    reads.
