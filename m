Before I go into some more detail, of course I fully agree that
dealing with erase/discard from the eMMC/SD specifications (and other
types of devices) point of view isn't entirely easy. :-)

But I also think we can do better than currently, at least for eMMC/SD.

Moreover, the specs have evolved over the years. Somehow, we need to
map a REQ_OP_DISCARD and REQ_OP_SECURE_ERASE to the best matching
operation that the currently inserted eMMC/SD card supports...

Long time time ago, both the SD and eMMC spec introduced support for
real discards commands, as being hints to the card without any
guarantees of what will happen to the data from a logical or a
physical point of view. If the card supports that, we should use it as
the first option for REQ_OP_DISCARD. Although, what should we pick as
the second best option, when the card doesn't support discard - that's
when it becomes more tricky. And the similar applies for
REQ_OP_SECURE_ERASE, or course.

If you have any suggestions for how we can improve in the above
decisions, feel free to suggest something.

Another issue that most likely is causing poor performance for
REQ_OP_DISCARD/REQ_OP_SECURE_ERASE for eMMC/SD, is that in
mmc_queue_setup_discard() we set up the maximum discard sectors
allowed per request and the discard granularity.

To find performance bottlenecks, I would start looking at what actual
eMMC/SD commands/args we end up mapping towards the
REQ_OP_DISCARD/REQ_OP_SECURE_ERASE requests. Then definitely, I would
also look at the values we end up picking as max discard sectors and
the discard granularity.

I agree, these are the three levels that make sense to support.

Honestly I haven't been paying enough attention to discussions for the
generic block layer around discards. However, considering what you
just stated above, we seem to be missing one request operation, don't
we?

Kind regards
