Thanks for both of your responses here!

I have a situation where I can re-create a problem switching from 1.8V
back to 3.3V with a specific card on a board that has ESD protection
between the IMX8MM host and the microSD connector (Semtech
ECLAMP2410P.TCT [1]) but works just fine on a previous revision of
that same PCB that does not have the ESD protection added. Boards with
proper ESD protection are the first time I've seen this issue occur.
Does this make sense at all?

I believe that the MMC device is 'reset' via a series of CLK cycles
with CMD/DAT non-asserted so I'm having a difficult time understanding
how this wouldn't work if the host has been reset to 3.3V.

Best Regards,

Tim
