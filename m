Alas, that is what we have today, because the platform_bus
is pretty much fake.

My initial reasoning was because Greg has expressed that
he thinks the platform_bus is overused and more specific
buses should be used, so I outlined a plan to make
OF not use the platform bus.

(Which is maybe too hard.)

The current way that the device tree parser uses the
platform bus is that it has no idea about what it is doing
when it comes to DMA, most of the time.

But maybe if we take a step back: can we make the
platform bus aware of what it is doing?

For example we have dma-ranges and similar properties
in the device tree, but subsystems call directly into
drivers/of/address.c to parse these out.

Would it be possible to tag nodes on the device tree
with the appropriate segment size and boundary
somehow also define the mask in the device tree in
a proper way, and have the platform.c parser actually
set this up correctly?

I am not aware that we have anything like this
currently, apart from the dma-ranges all DMA DT
bindings we have seems to pertain to DMA engines.

(I suppose the same apply for ACPI.)
