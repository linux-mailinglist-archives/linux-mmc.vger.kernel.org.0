I have checked with the schematics but the wlan_en regulator-fixed is =
just a GPIO
controlling some pin of the wifi chip.

I guess it enables some regulator or power switch inside the wifi module =
which
has unknown voltage.

We can interpret this as two sequential power-switches. The first one =
controlled
by the gpio-register bit and switches gpio power to the gpio pad of the =
SoC. The second
one switches the battery voltage to the internal circuits of the wifi =
module.

The GPIO itself is on 1.8V VIO level which seems to be the reason for =
the min/max.

Now it is a little arbitrary what the DTS describes: the gpio voltage or =
the unknown
internal voltage of the second switch.

So from hardware perspective the min/max values are irrelevant.

Ok, if the mmc driver does something with these values it may have =
indeed an influence.

Well, with min/max=3D3.3V and no ocr I get:

[    2.765136] omap_hsmmc 480ad000.mmc: card claims to support voltages =
below defined range
[    2.776367] omap_hsmmc 480ad000.mmc: found wl1251
[    2.782287] mmc2: new SDIO card at address 0001
[   10.874237] omap_hsmmc 480ad000.mmc: could not set regulator OCR =
(-22)
[   10.945373] wl1251_sdio: probe of mmc2:0001:1 failed with error -16

Adding back card->ocr =3D 0x80 (and keeping 3.3V for min/max) shows =
exactly the same.

Only min/max 1.8V + OCR works:

[    2.824188] mmc2: new SDIO card at address 0001
[    2.806518] omap_hsmmc 480ad000.mmc: card claims to support voltages =
below defined range
[    2.815979] omap_hsmmc 480ad000.mmc: found wl1251
[   10.981018] omap_hsmmc 480ad000.mmc: found wl1251
[   11.018280] wl1251: using dedicated interrupt line
[   11.321136] wl1251: loaded

[   14.521759] omap_hsmmc 480ad000.mmc: found wl1251
[   38.680725] omap_hsmmc 480ad000.mmc: found wl1251
[   39.646942] wl1251: 151 tx blocks at 0x3b788, 35 rx blocks at 0x3a780
[   39.654785] wl1251: firmware booted (Rev 4.0.4.3.7)

Therefore I also tried the 4th combination: min/max 1.8V and no ocr =
quirk and it fails again.

Finally I tried setting min to 2.7V and max to 3.6V. This ends up in

[    0.402648] reg-fixed-voltage fixed-regulator-wg7210_en: Fixed =
regulator specified with variable voltages

So it seems that we need both: min/max =3D 1.8V and OCR. A little =
unexpected since I had expected
that min/max is completely irrelevant.

> If that works, we should add some comments about it above, I think.

So at the moment no change for [PATCH v1] which I can now send out.

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
