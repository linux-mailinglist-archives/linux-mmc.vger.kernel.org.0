That sounds promising.

I see, thanks for sharing!

Assuming I don't find any issues when I am testing some of my older SD
cards, I am definitely open to change into what you propose in
$subject patch.

Although, I think it's important that we also state in the code with a
comment somewhere - that we deliberately have decided to deviate from
the SD spec for the reasons you have pointed out in our discussions.

Can you perhaps prepare and post a new version and possibly also work
a little bit on the commit message to make things a bit more clear?

In the meantime, I will test some SD cards at my side...

Kind regards
Uffe
