That's correct. Since the platform uses SCMI and SCMI spec[1] supports Voltage
protocol and there is upstream driver[2] to support it, I see no point in
duplicating the support with another custom/non-standard solution.

Mark has already pointed you to the binding document[3]

Yes, it should be easy to extend the implementation and add support for
voltage protocol.

If you still face any issues, please ask any queries on the list cc-ing
