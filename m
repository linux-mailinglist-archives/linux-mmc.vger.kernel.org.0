I suppose to make the submission non-blocking, all operations that
currently block in the submission path may have to be changed first.

For the case of a partition switch (same for retune), I suppose
something like this can be done:

- in queue_rq() check whether a partition switch is needed. If not,
  submit the current rq
- if a partition switch is needed, submit the partition switch cmd
  instead, and return busy status
- when the completion arrives for the partition switch, call back into
  blk_mq to have it call queue_rq again.

Or possibly even (this might not be possible without signifcant
restructuring):

- when preparing a request that would require a partition switch,
  insert another meta-request to switch the partition ahead of it.

I do realize that this is a significant departure from how it was done
in the past, but it seems cleaner that way to me.

I hope Hannes (or someone else) can comment here, as I don't
know exactly what his objection to kicking off the next cmd in the
hardirq was.

I think generally, deferring all slow operations to an irqthread
rather than a softirq is a good idea, but I share your concern that
this can introduce an unnecessary latency between the the
the IRQ is signaled and the time the following cmd is sent to the
hardware.

Doing everything in a single (irqthread) context is clearly simpler,
so this would need to be measured carefully to avoid unnecessary
complexity, but I think don't see anything stopping us from having
the fast-path where the low-level driver first checks for any possible
error conditions in hardirq context and the fires off a prepared cmd
right away whenever it can before triggering the irqthread that does
everything else. I think this has to be a per-driver optimization, so
the common case would just have an irqthread.

The only way I can see is the ->last flag, so if blk_mq submits multiple
requests in a row to queue_rq() with this flag cleared and  calls
->commit_rqs() after the last one. This seems to be what the scsi
disk driver and the nvme driver rely on, and we should be able to use
it the same way for packed cmds, by checking each time in queue_rq()
whether requests can/should be combined and reporting busy otherwise
(after preparing a combined mmc cmd).
blk_mq will then call commit_rqs, which should do the actual submission
to the hardware driver.

Now as you point out, the *big* problem with this is that we never
get multiple requests together in practice, i.e. the last flag is almost
always set, and any optimization around it has no effect.

This is where I'm a bit lost in the code as well, but it seems that
this is part of the current bfq design that only sends one request down
the driver stack at a time, and this would have to change first before
we can rely on this for packing requests.

Paolo, can you comment on why this is currently done, or if it can
be changed? It seems to me that sending multiple requests at
once would also have a significant benefit on the per-request overhead
on NVMe devices with with bfq.
