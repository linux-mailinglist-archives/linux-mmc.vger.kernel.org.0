Hello!

So to answer my own question, we got information that USB-IF really
maintains and assigns PCMCIA vendor ids which are still used also for
SDIO vendor ids in SDIO cards.

New version 4 of SDIO specification mention this fact but "Simplified"
specification which is freely available and from which I quoted part
about CISTPL_MANFID was not updated yet to reflect changes.
