Sure.

Only via the historical ACPI tables. There isn't any attempt to get 
ACPI+Linux working on the rpi3. Its to far away from BSA. For starters 
it doesn't have a GIC. So while one could bind this driver on the rpi3, 
that would require being able to boot Linux on the rpi3 in ACPI mode.

Thanks again!
