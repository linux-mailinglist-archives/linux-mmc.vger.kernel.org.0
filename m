No Windows has the same problem.

I have not tried, but yes that should work, but until we get some generic
mechanism (*) in Linux / distro-s to provide DSDT overrides, that is not
helpful for regular Linux users.

*) which also has copyright issues, so the chances of this ever happening
are slim

For this specific issue, chances are not that big we will need it
on another device. The quirk added by the second patch, to disable
(broken) read-only detection OTOH might very well be useful on some
other devices.

And adding the option to override the quirks from the kernel commandline
requires very little extra code.

Anyways, it is your call. Please let me know if you want to drop the
module parameter for v2, or if you are ok with keeping it.

Regards,

Hans
