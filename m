The reason that patches fixes SD init for you is because in original 
patch, quirk was applied for both SD and eMMC with the exception of SD 
for am64x SoC. This patch only applies the quirk for eMMC.

We cannot use the original implementation because the logic applying the 
quirk is based off of vmmc/vqmmc nodes in DT. The assumption was that 
am64x based boards will only have vmmc node since there is an internal 
LDO that is used to switch IO signal voltage instead of vqmmc. However, 
SolidRun HimmingBoard-T board has a different implementation on voltage 
regulator nodes in DT and the quirk applied to them as well and breaks 
their SD boot. So we now only apply the quirk for eMMC. Without this 
quirk applied to SD, am62x SD will continue having some stability issues.
