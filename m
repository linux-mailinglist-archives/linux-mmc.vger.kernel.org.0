Having read the code, I remain to be convinced of that equivalence.
Are you sure it's not an expectation on your part, rather than a
true equivalence (see below.)

My comment reflects my investigations into all possible routes to find
an answer to the issue at hand.  I can't find in the code any
correlation between the DMA API's idea of coherency and the _CCA
attribute for ACPI devices.  As far as I can see, it's entirely
possible for the two to disagree - to the extent that I believe that
the DMA API will default to assuming non-coherence whereas the ACPI
code defaults to assuming coherence - and there is no path in the ACPI
code that sets dev->dma_coherent for ACPI devices.

For platform and PCI devices, yes, I agree. But for ACPI devices, it
seems dev->dma_coherent is left uninitialised - or I could not locate
where it gets initialised.  My conclusion is that for ACPI devices,
setting _CCA=1 or allowing it to default to 1 results in a mismatch
between what the DMA API believes and what device_get_dma_attr() would
return.  Given what I understand, the above seems to be far from a
tautology.

If you feel differently, please reference the code so I can get a
better understanding of the ACPI code - but my position that there is
a mismatch between the DMA API and devices is based on grepping the
code and following the various paths.
