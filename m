If you want to put the card into a low power state after a period of
idle, you can set MMC_CAP_AGGRESSIVE_PM for the corresponding mmc
host.

Be careful though, as you will prevent the card from doing internal
garbage collection if you power it off. It may be a good idea to
extend the idle period for this, which can be done from userspace via
sysfs.

No matter if you have MMC_CAP_AGGRESSIVE_PM or not, system resume time
should not be affected. Re-initialization of the SD/eMMC cards are
deferred to be managed through runtime PM, which means that the card
will be resumed the next time there is a command/request to be sent to
the card.

Assuming there is no I/O request after the system has resumed, then a
non-removable card (host has MMC_CAP_NONREMOVABLE set), typically an
eMMC, will thus remain in low power state even after the system has
resumed.

For a removable card (typically SD cards), there is a limitation that
we need to check if the card remains inserted after the system has
resumed. Although, note that this is done in a workqueue, thus not
affecting the overall system resume time. Still, we do end up
re-initializing of removable cards, just to check that they are still
inserted, which certainly is not always a good thing to do.

The above code in the mmc core was introduced around kernel v3.11,
even if it has been fine tuned since then.

Maybe you have been using even older kernels?

Improvements can certainly be done and would be greatly appreciated.

If you want to look at optimizing the behaviour, I suggest trying to
avoid the re-initialization of removable cards during system resume.
It's not possible for all cases, but certainly for some.

If you care about system resume time of SDIO cards, there are even
more improvements that can be made.
