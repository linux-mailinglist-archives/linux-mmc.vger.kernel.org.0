Hello Axe,

sorry for the wait - this email fell through the cracks and I didn't see
it at all, so thank you for the ping.

Unfortunately, I don't think that this would be acceptable from a devicetree and/or
bindings standpoint, but then you don't really need to modify the pdata for all of
the currently supported SoCs to declare false, as false==0, which is the default.

But maybe there's another way out of this.

You said that this modification is done because some controllers are under AXI and
some others are under AHB... I was doing some cleanups to this driver and doing so
made me check a couple of things....

When a MSDC controller is under AXI, there will be configuration for that in other
registers - specifically, I'm wondering if the EMMC50_CFG2 register can be used to
check if we are under an AHB to AXI wrapper or not.

The idea is to read this register (offset 0x21c), [27:24] AXI_SET_LEN contains the
number of beats per burst (from 1 to 16), and also [23:19] AXI_RX_OUTSTANDING_NUM
contains the number of outstanding transfers (1 to 13).

If a controller does not have an AXI2AHB Wrapper, or if it does not use the AXI bus
this register should read zero I think?

Especially the two fields that I mentioned before, those should read zero.

That, especially because the hwaddr for the controllers is anyway and always long
0x1000 - and I think that the extra registers space, on controllers that don't have
the EMMC50 registers (msdc1 and msdc2) should be still reserved to those and never
used for anything else.

Would that detection way work?

If it would, we'd be again autodetecting whether to set or not the AXI single burst
option in the patch bits...without relying on specifying anything manually, not in
the devicetree, and not in the platform data :-)

Cheers,
Angelo
