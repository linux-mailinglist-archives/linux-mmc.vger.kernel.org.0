Hi Adrian,

I know you have sofar mostly resisted adding device specific (DMI based)
quirks to the sdhci-acpi.c driver and I agree with you that whenever
possible, those should be avoided.

But yesterday I was debugging an issue where using the microSD slot
causes the LCD panel of a tablet to go black. This turns out to be a
bug in the DSDT which gets triggered when using 1.8V modes, see the first
patch for details. In this case I really so no other option then disablin=
g
1.8V modes and only doing so only on the affected device model.

Another issue which I had on my TODO list of things to fix is the Acer
SW5-012 version of the Acer Switch 10 models always reporting the microSD
as being write-protected. Here too I see no other option then a model
specific quirk, since some BYT devices may use a normal SD slot with
actual write-protect capabilities and we do not want to disable
write-protect checking everywhere just because it is broken on one model.
The workaround for this is the second patch in this series.

Regards,

Hans
