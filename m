Again, I think you have misunderstood how it works from the core point of view.

->req_cleanup_pending() will never be able to terminate a request in a
proper way, without involving the mmc core's knowledge about the
eMMC/SD protocol.

Yes, it could clean up from an ongoing DMA transfer, but that doesn't
bring the eMMC/SD card back into a state where it can accept new
requests.

I fully understand the approach, but again, it doesn't work. Sorry.

As I said, the only thing that *could* work is to call
mmc_claim_host() in the panic write hook -  and hope for the best. If
it succeeds, there is nothing to cleanup or terminate.

Kind regards
