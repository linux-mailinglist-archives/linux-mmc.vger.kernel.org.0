Subject: [PATCH V23 00/16] Add support UHS-II for GL9755 and GL9767

Summary
=======
These patches[1] support UHS-II and fix GL9755 and GL9767
UHS-II compatibility.

About UHS-II, roughly deal with the following three parts:
1) A UHS-II detection and initialization:
- Host setup to support UHS-II (Section 3.13.1 Host Controller Setup
  Sequence[2]).
- Detect a UHS-II I/F (Section 3.13.2 Card Interface Detection Sequence
  [2]).
- In step(9) of Section 3.13.2 in [2], UHS-II initialization is include
  Section 3.13.3 UHS-II Card Initialization and Section 3.13.4 UHS-II
  Setting Register Setup Sequence.

2) Send Legacy SD command through SD-TRAN
- Encapsulated SD packets are defined in SD-TRAN in order to ensure Legacy
  SD compatibility and preserve Legacy SD infrastructures (Section 7.1.1
  Packet Types and Format Overview[3]).
- Host issue a UHS-II CCMD packet or a UHS-II DCMD (Section 3.13.5 UHS-II
  CCMD Packet issuing and Section 3.13.6 UHS-II DCMD Packet issuing[2]).

3) UHS-II Interrupt
- Except for UHS-II error interrupts, most interrupts share the original
  interrupt registers.

Changes in v23 (October. 18, 2024)
* Rebase on latest mmc/next.
* Version 22 patch#1-patch#6 have already been applied to the mmc/next
  branch, so the patch order for version 23 has been shifted forward.
* Patch#1: Remove mmc_uhs2_card_prepare_cmd() function.
           Remove mmc_sd_can_poweroff_notify() function.
           Modify ios.timing setting in the sd_uhs2_power_off() function.
           Restore the position of assign the host->card to original
           position in the sd_uhs2_init_card() function.
           Remove unnecessary error handle in the sd_uhs2_init_card()
           function.
           Add oldcard judgment to skip some programs in the
           sd_uhs2_legacy_init() function.
           Remove unnecessary error handle in the sd_uhs2_legacy_init()
           function.
           Remove mmc_card_set_present() function in the
           sd_uhs2_reinit()function.

Summary
=======
These patches[1] support UHS-II and fix GL9755 and GL9767
UHS-II compatibility.

About UHS-II, roughly deal with the following three parts:
1) A UHS-II detection and initialization:
- Host setup to support UHS-II (Section 3.13.1 Host Controller Setup
  Sequence[2]).
- Detect a UHS-II I/F (Section 3.13.2 Card Interface Detection Sequence
  [2]).
- In step(9) of Section 3.13.2 in [2], UHS-II initialization is include
  Section 3.13.3 UHS-II Card Initialization and Section 3.13.4 UHS-II
  Setting Register Setup Sequence.

2) Send Legacy SD command through SD-TRAN
- Encapsulated SD packets are defined in SD-TRAN in order to ensure Legacy
  SD compatibility and preserve Legacy SD infrastructures (Section 7.1.1
  Packet Types and Format Overview[3]).
- Host issue a UHS-II CCMD packet or a UHS-II DCMD (Section 3.13.5 UHS-II
  CCMD Packet issuing and Section 3.13.6 UHS-II DCMD Packet issuing[2]).

3) UHS-II Interrupt

Changes in v19 (August. 29, 2024)
* Rebase on latest mmc/next.

            safety check in the __sdhci_uhs2_finish_command().

* Patch#22: Use sdhci_gli_enable_internal_clock() to simplify the code
            in the sdhci_gl9767_reset().
            Directly reading the SDHCI_PRESENT_STATE register to replace
            the get_cd() avoids the possibility of the get_cd() sleeping
            in the sdhci_gl9767_set_card_detect_debounce_time().
            Refine the position of gli_set_9767() in the

- Host setup to support UHS-II (Section 3.13.1 Host Controller Setup
  Sequence[2]).
- Detect a UHS-II I/F (Section 3.13.2 Card Interface Detection Sequence
  [2]).
- In step(9) of Section 3.13.2 in [2], UHS-II initialization is include
  Section 3.13.3 UHS-II Card Initialization and Section 3.13.4 UHS-II
  Setting Register Setup Sequence.

2) Send Legacy SD command through SD-TRAN
- Encapsulated SD packets are defined in SD-TRAN in order to ensure Legacy
  SD compatibility and preserve Legacy SD infrastructures (Section 7.1.1
  Packet Types and Format Overview[3]).
- Host issue a UHS-II CCMD packet or a UHS-II DCMD (Section 3.13.5 UHS-II
  CCMD Packet issuing and Section 3.13.6 UHS-II DCMD Packet issuing[2]).

3) UHS-II Interrupt
- Except for UHS-II error interrupts, most interrupts share the original
  interrupt registers.

----------------- original cover letter from v5 -----------------
Summary
=======
These patches[1] support UHS-II and fix GL9755 UHS-II compatibility.

About UHS-II, roughly deal with the following three parts:
1) A UHS-II detection and initialization:
- Host setup to support UHS-II (Section 3.13.1 Host Controller Setup Sequence
  [2]).
- Detect a UHS-II I/F (Section 3.13.2 Card Interface Detection Sequence[2]).
- In step(9) of Section 3.13.2 in [2], UHS-II initialization is include Section
  3.13.3 UHS-II Card Initialization and Section 3.13.4 UHS-II Setting Register
  Setup Sequence.

2) Send Legacy SD command through SD-TRAN
- Encapsulated SD packets are defined in SD-TRAN in order to ensure Legacy SD
  compatibility and preserve Legacy SD infrastructures (Section 7.1.1 Packet
  Types and Format Overview[3]).
- Host issue a UHS-II CCMD packet or a UHS-II DCMD (Section 3.13.5 UHS-II
  CCMD Packet issuing and Section 3.13.6 UHS-II DCMD Packet issuing[2]).

3) UHS-II Interrupt
- Except for UHS-II error interrupts, most interrupts share the original
  interrupt registers.

Changes in v5 (Oct. 19, 2022)
* rebased to the linux-kernel-v6.1-rc1 in Ulf Hansson next branch.
* according to the guidance and overall architecture provided 
  by Ulf Hansson, Ben Chuang and Jason Lai to implement the
  UHS-2 Core function based on the patches of the [V4,0/6] 
  Preparations to support SD UHS-II cards[5].
* according to the guidance and comments provided by 
  Adrian Hunter, Ben Chuang and AKASHI Takahiro to implement 
  the UHS-2 Host function based on the patches of the 
  [RFC,v3.1,00/27] Add support UHS-II for GL9755[4].
* implement the necessary function to let the UHS-2 Core/Host
  work properly.
* fix most of checkpatch warnings/errors

----------------- original cover letter from v3.1 -----------------
This is an interim snapshot of our next version, v4, for enabling
UHS-II on MMC/SD.

It is focused on 'sdhci' side to address Adrian's comments regarding
"modularising" sdhci-uhs2.c.
The whole aim of this version is to get early feedback from Adrian (and
others) on this issue. Without any consensus about the code structure,
it would make little sense to go further ahead on sdhci side.
(Actually, Adrian has made no comments other than "modularising" so far.)

I heavily reworked/refactored sdhci-uhs2.c and re-organised the patch
set to meet what I believe Adrian expects; no UHS-II related code in
Legacy (UHS-I) code or sdhci.c.

Nevertheless, almost of all changes I made are trivial and straightforward
in this direction, and I believe that there is no logic changed since v3
except sdhci_uhs2_irq(), as ops->irq hook, where we must deal with UHS-II
command sequences in addition to UHS-II errors. So I added extra handlings.

I admit that there is plenty of room for improvements (for example,
handling host->flags), but again the focal point here is how sdhci-uhs2.c
should be built as a module.

Please review this series (particularly Patch#8-#26 and #27) from this
viewpoint in the first place.
(Ben is working on 'host' side but there is no change on 'host' side
in this submission except a minor tweak.)

Thanks,
-Takahiro Akashi

Tests
=====
Ran 'dd' command to evaluate the performance:
(SanDisk UHS-II card on GL9755 controller)
                             Read    Write
UHS-II disabled (UHS-I): 88.3MB/s 60.7MB/s
UHS-II enabled         :  206MB/s   80MB/s

TODO
====
- replace some define with BIT macro
