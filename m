Because mmc_set_signal_voltage() optionally calls
host->ops_>start_signal_voltage_switch() , which can now return value >
0 , so the rest of the core needs to be patched to cater for that.

Yes. So a failure is now only a return value < 0.

I think the core parts are necessary as well though , see above.
