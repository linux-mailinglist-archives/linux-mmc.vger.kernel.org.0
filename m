Only the hardware CQE provides inline encryption support.  In particular, the
hardware interface to program keyslots uses the CQE registers, as does the
hardware interface to assign keyslots and DUNs to particular read/write
requests.  So my understanding is that eMMC inline encryption isn't compatible
with eMMC commands being issued in ways other than the hardware CQE, such as via
the HSQ (host software queue) feature, or via "packed requests".  So those
features can't be enabled in combination with inline encryption.
