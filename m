Are you saying that that being able to work with locked card is not an
improvement in comparison to not being able to? Or did I misunderstand
that?

It's not half-way initialized, it's initialized correctly, it's just not
using the full potential of the card (higher speeds, etc.).

The situation would be the same as it is currently with emmc. Locked
emmc gets initialized correctly but reads/writes time-out. What is wrong
in having the same result for both sd and emmc?

Okay, this is a valid concern. Would it be acceptable if we just enabled
this "feature" with a module parameter, something like
"sd_initialize_locked=1" with default 0?

It doesn't solve the situation when you don't know the password and you
just want to erase the card and continue using in. The (un)locking
doesn't belong to kernel IMO, if it can be implemented in user-space, it
should and it is more flexible that way.

Okay, Al, are you interested?
