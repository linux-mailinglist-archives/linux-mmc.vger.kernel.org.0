Unfortunately this patch appears corrupted, requiring me to manually
recreate it. It seems the process of including it as text in the email
body has corrupted the text, including hard-wrapping the @@ lines into
multiple lines and converting tabs into spaces, so the patch no longer
maps to the Linux source code (eg. drivers/mmc/core/core.c). These
errors were present in Thunderbird, lore.kernel.org, and marc.info
(where downloading the raw emails additionally
equals-encodes/Quoted-Printable? special characters breaking the patch
further).

Additionally Adrian's email seems to be an informal patch rather than a
machine-readable specification.

I'm attemping to manually replicate the changes on Fedora 43's
kernel-6.18.3 checkout
(https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/kernel-build-custom/),
though I'm much less experienced building kernels here than on Arch
Linux (the Arch SSD is currently in another computer). I will be
replying back with results once I can build and test these patches.
