The device tree should be a description of the hardware and there
really is a 'u0_sdio_data_strobe_phase_ctrl' field in the sysreg
registers[1] on the JH7110 that seems to do _something_ related to the
sdio interface. So I don't think the fact that the Linux driver no
longer uses it is a good reason to remove it, but if there are some
other pragmatic reasons to do so then I'm fine with it. Removing it
from the list of required properties should be fine though.
