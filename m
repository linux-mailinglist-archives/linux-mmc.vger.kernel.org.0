I understand the reason for having the software timeout. And after reading
the documentation for the rk3399 TRM it came clear to me why the current
code looks the way it is. However, the Samsung manual (which is the one
I have) does not follow the (standard?) TMOUT:DATA_TIMEOUT field definition,
but instead it states:

  For card data read timeout (DRTO):
   [31:8]: ((TMOUT[10:8]-1)*0xffffff + TMOUT[31:11] * 8) cycle

  For host starvation timeout (HTO): TMOUT[31:8] cycle 

We will ask Samsung about this.

Yes, that was one of my intentions with this patch, but clearly I
stumbled on the DATA_TIMEOUT bits, which (at least with the Samsung
version) I thought could give us much more time. Unfortunately I don't
have access to the original DesignWare dwmmc manual, which would of course
bring more light to this.

Agree. But we will ask Samsung before uploading a patch for this.

Agree. Good point. Vincent also suggested splitting it into three
different patches.

Good point. Will look into that.

I always wondered about this. On our hardware we don't always get the DTO
after errors which is why it (to us) seems the driver is relying on the
dto_timer to complete the state machine. So again, yes, it seems we have
a different version of this controller, and a quirk is probably needed
to make this efficient for us.
