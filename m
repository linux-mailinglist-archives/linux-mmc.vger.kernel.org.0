There are 2 paths which are traced to this function when card initializes
in HS400 mode, please consider below call stack in 2 paths

sdhci_msm_configure_dll
sdhci_msm_dll_config
sdhci_msm_execute_tuning
mmc_execute_tuning
mmc_init_card
_mmc_resume
mmc_runtime_resume

with values of host->clock as 200000000 & msm_host-clk_rate as 400000000
and host->flags as 0x90c6.

and

sdhci_msm_configure_dll
sdhci_msm_dll_config
sdhci_msm_set_uhs_signaling
sdhci_set_ios
mmc_set_clock
mmc_set_bus_speed
mmc_select_hs400
mmc_init_card
_mmc_resume
mmc_runtime_resume

with values of host->clock as 200000000 & msm_host-clk_rate as 400000000
and host->flags as 0x90c6 which are same as 1st.

Now if card is initialized in HS200 mode only below is the call stack

sdhci_msm_configure_dll
sdhci_msm_dll_config
sdhci_msm_execute_tuning
mmc_execute_tuning
mmc_init_card
_mmc_resume
mmc_runtime_resume

with values of host->clock as 200000000 & msm_host-clk_rate as 200000000
and host->flags as 0x90c6.

now if you see the host->flags value, its same across the modes, and if
I am getting it right from the pointed out function
sdhci_msm_hc_select_mode(), your suggestion seems to be using the check
host->flags & SDHCI_HS400_TUNING which is bit[13], but in above dumped
host->flags SDHCI_HS400_TUNING bit is not set where we are using the /2.

and the reason is, this bit is getting cleared in sdhci_msm_execute_tuning()
before sdhci_msm_dll_config() call.

so this /2, is eventually called only for HS400 mode.

Thanks,
Ram

Took it up from sachin last month but still its a long gap.
