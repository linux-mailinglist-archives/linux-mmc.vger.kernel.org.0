First time it helped me it was rotating rust actually, but yeah MMC/SD
is one of those.

Hm I think you're mixing up different resource constraints here (that
your storage is slow does not mean your CPU is weak or that you have
little RAM) but I see your point.

What I think a lot of the debate is about is "abundance of resources"
systems vs "constrained resources" systems. Some are hard to keep
busy (such as MQ devices) other are hard to get access through
because of constant overload (such as MMC/SD-cards).

Well *using* it is still the matter of a udev rule for an ordinary distro
as we have no mechanism to instruct the kernel to use any specific
scheduler with some subsystem. (I think we should have some hint
for that, for slow single channel devices for example.)

The Kconfig change is mainly about making it available for use,
for systems with MMC/SD-card drivers.
