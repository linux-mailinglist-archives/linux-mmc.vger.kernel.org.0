The best I can come up with is something like:

	enum dev_dma_attr attr, expected;

	attr = device_get_dma_attr(dev);
	expected = dev_is_dma_coherent(dev) ? DEV_DMA_COHERENT :
			DEV_DMA_NON_COHERENT;

	WARN_ON(attr != expected);

Maybe even aborting the probe if they don't agree.  However, it seems
dev_is_dma_coherent() is an IOMMU/DMA API implementation detail that
only IOMMU drivers and arch code are supposed to use.

What I'm hearing at the moment from Jon Nettleton is that the NXP ACPI
description does not include an IORT table and doesn't mention the
SMMU.  If I'm reading the code correctly, that means the Linux DMA API
will assume all devices are DMA non-coherent - and if we use
device_get_dma_attr() for this, and the ACPI device description has
_CCA=1, we'll end up with potentially data corrupting mismatched DMA
coherency expectations.
