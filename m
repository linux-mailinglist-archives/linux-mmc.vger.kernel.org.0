When patches 1-6 are applied, there is no qcom,ice property in DTS. Thus
I don't consider the test as correct... Even if we skip entire ABI
discussion the patchset is non-bisectable thus the test was failing to
detect even that.

At point of patch 6 none of nodes have it. That's the entire point of
bisectability.

What's more, if you reverse code and makes DTS patches before driver
hoping to fix bisectability - do you see ICE working on existing
platforms? I don't think it so...

For the driver this sounds good. I still think that existing (older) DTS
should not have regs removed, because this affects other users of kernel
DTS.
