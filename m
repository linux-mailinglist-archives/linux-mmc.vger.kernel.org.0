Sounds reasonable, but perhaps still enforce a minimum, for some of the same
reasons as commit 1c447116d017 ?
e.g.

	if (!card->ext_csd.part_time)
		card->ext_csd.part_time = card->ext_csd.generic_cmd6_time;
	if (card->ext_csd.part_time < MMC_MIN_PART_SWITCH_TIME)
		card->ext_csd.part_time = MMC_MIN_PART_SWITCH_TIME;
