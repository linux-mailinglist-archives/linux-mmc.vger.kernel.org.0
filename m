What brought this front and center is actually another bug with the
dw-mmc-rk driver (I don't know if it affects other dw-mmc drivers)
vmmc is 3.3v on this board, but with broken-cd set polling causes the
following splat constantly.

I looked through the code path and if the OCR voltage is set to the
fixed regulator voltage it should just return success. I think I need
to change that error to output the voltage it tried to set, just to
see if something weird is going on.

Also, I've got a possible fix to the dw-mmc issue, the following patch
changes the behavior to only enable a fixed regulator, not try to set
the voltage. It's a split between the behavior when vmmc isn't defined
at all and when its a variable regulator:
