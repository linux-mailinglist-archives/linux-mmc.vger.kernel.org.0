Well, honestly I don't know how to best manage this.

Some people move into using a personal stable email, even for work
related issues, but it's not really ideal and it simply isn't a good
fit for all cases.

As I don't have a good answer for you, let's keep your cc, then we can
come back how to deal with this.

That's certainly a good idea. Do you want to send a patch? Or just
tell me and I can do it.

We are more or less trying to follow the principles of how to
contribute to the kernel.
Avri acts as a reviewer and I take care of the git tree.
