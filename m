Yes, this sounds good enough.

I think having one key type should be enough. The userspace loads /
generates&reads / wraps and reads back the 'exported' version wrapped
using the platform-specific key. In kernel the key is unsealed and
represented as binary key to be loaded to the hardware + a cookie for
the ephemeral key and device that have been used to wrap it. When
userspace asks the device to program the key, the cookie is verified
to match the device / ephemeral key and then the binary is programmed
to the hardware. Maybe it's enough to use the struct device as a
cookie.

Are we going to have another set of IOCTLs for loading the encrypted
keys? keys sealed by TPM?

I see. I was confused by the dm code then. Please excuse me.

No, the user can not set modparams on  e.g. Android device. In my
opinion it should be first-come-first-serve. If the user wants
hw-wrapped keys (and the platform is fine with that), then further
attempts to use raw keys should fail. If the user loads a raw key,
further attempts to set hw-wrapped key should fail (maybe until the
last raw key has been evicted from the hw, if such thing is actually
supported).
