OK. I guess if everyone else understands this and it's just me that
doesn't then I won't stand in the way. In general, though, the device
tree is supposed to be describing the hardware in a way that makes
sense on its own. It's not a place to just dump in magic numbers.
These numbers must be somehow related to the transfer rate of the SD
card since otherwise they wouldn't scale up with faster card clocks.
Given that these numbers are expressed in "kBps" (since you're storing
them in a property that has "kBps" in the name), I would expect that
these numbers are expressing some type of bandwidth. I still haven't
really understood why you have to scale some bandwidth at over 10x the
card clock speed.

Said another way: you're saying that you need these numbers because
they make a whole bunch of math work out. I'm saying that these aren't
just supposed to be magic numbers. They're supposed to make sense on
their own and you should be able to describe to me how you arrived at
these numbers in a way that I could do the math on my own. Saying "we
plugged this into some program and it spit out these numbers" isn't
good enough.

Sorry, but that is really counter-intuitive. Georgi: is that how this
is normally expected to work?
