It does send the command, the card rejects them as ILLEGAL and does not
respond, rightfully so, because it is still in data receive state.
A card only moves out of data receive after CMD25 if the blocks
set by CMD23 were sent or CMD12 is received.
The card seems to be behaving fine AFAICT.

CMD12 should suffice too, no?

This is the real issue, if that does happen.
Particularly the former, the kernel shouldn't send a CMD25 with 0
blocks.
If this happens during normal operation too (not mmc_test) a trace
would be interesting.
