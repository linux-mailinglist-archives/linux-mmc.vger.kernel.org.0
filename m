You're right, I changed that locally and missed it.

Is it? I mean usually they configure the boot partition, too and mmc-utils gives them all they need with:
e.g. mmc-utils bootpart enable 1 0 /dev/mmcblkX
But yeah, if this is too much of a limitation to be considered useful then this patch is not worth pursuing as pretending the boot operation is a normal block transfer for ioctl and the host driver only works with boot ack off.
Anything with boot ack on cannot be done from userspace and not even host-controller-agnostic, i.e. would need its own host_ops call, which is a bit overkill for testing / debugging purposes I'd say.
