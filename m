Hi Ulf,

The behavior of this patch is to set the value of a GL9763e vendor
specified register. Why it doesn't belong to GL9763e driver but other
common codes?

Yes, according to our customer's test for the GL9763e, if the ASPM L1
entry delay of GL9763e, which is the idle period you mentioned, is
larger than 20/21 us, it will not pass the PLT test. The PLT is
requested by Google for evaluating the product's battery life. The
product won't be accepted by Google if it fails the PLT test. So we
set the ASPM L1 entry delay to 20/21us.

With such a short idle period, during 4K reads, the idle time between
the read requests will be larger than 20/21us, so GL9763e will enter
ASPM L1 very frequently to impact the performance.

The bad performance of 4K reads was highlighted by Google, too. Our
customer has to pass both the PLT test and 4K read performance test by
Google's request. So after some discussions with our customer and
Google, we decided to submit such a patch to get the best balance to
satisfy Google's requiremnet.

The function and the register is vendor specified of GL9763e, so we
access it in the vendor driver of GL9763e. Add some functions in other
mmc general codes to do something only for GL9763e and can not be
applied by other devices might be a little bit strange and difficult
to implement and design?


Thanks for your comments.
