I fully understand what you want to do.

Maybe runtime PM isn't the perfect fit for this type of use case.

That still doesn't matter to to me, I will not accept this kind of
governor/policy based code for use cases, in drivers. It doesn't
belong there.

From the use case point of view, the GL9763e hardware design isn't at
all specific.

In many cases, controllers/platforms have support for low power states
that one want to enter to avoid wasting energy. The difficult part is
to know *when* it makes sense to enter a low power state, as it also
introduces a latency when the power needs to be restored for the
device, to allow it to serve a new request.

To me, it sounds like you may have been too aggressive on avoid
wasting energy. If I understand correctly the idle period you use is
20/21 us, while most other drivers use 50-100 ms as idle period.
