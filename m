Adrian, I had a go at changing the controller quirk to a card quirk.

Unfortunately, SDHCI_QUIRK2_HOST_NO_CMD23 does not directly translate to
MMC_QUIRK_BLK_NO_CMD23, as for 'do_rel_wr' in mmc_blk_rw_rq_prep(), it
will *still* use MMC_SET_BLOCK_COUNT (cmd23), causing the issue.

We are using a ISSI "IS004G" device, and so I have gone through the
motions of adding it to quirks.h. The comment before the list of devices
using MMC_QUIRK_BLK_NO_CMD23 suggest working around a performance issue,
which is not exactly the issue I'm seeing. I'm seeing combinations of
CMD_TOUT_ERR, DATA_CRC_ERR and DATA_END_BIT_ERR whenever a cmd23 is
issued.

I have not been able to test the controller with another eMMC device
yet, but I expect its not the controller at fault.

So, I'm a little bit in doubt of how to proceed - either keep the quirk
as a controller quirk - or make a *new* card quirk (with
SDHCI_QUIRK2_HOST_NO_CMD23 semantics)?

Anybody else have had experience with ISSI eMMC devices?

I have also tried to use DT sdhci-caps-mask, but MMC_CAP_CMD23 is not
read from the controller just (unconditionally) set in sdhci.c - so that
doesn't fly either.

Any suggestions?
