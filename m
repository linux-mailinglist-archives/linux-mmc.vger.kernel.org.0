Indeed, I had just arrived at the same conclusion.
While genpd doesn't have reference counting on start/stop, pm_clk does
have pce_status to track state, so when needed, __pm_clk_remove()
disables the clock before its destruction.

Correct.

No, it's just a bit strange to see an imbalance in start/stop.

Note that this does mean that all PM domain providers that do not rely
on pm_clk, but have their own start/stop methods, need to be aware of
this quirk, and should take care of reference counting themselves.
Fortunately there seems to be only one:
drivers/soc/ti/ti_sci_pm_domains.c.
Unfortunately it doesn't do reference counting, so if that PM domain
driver is ever used with a driver that calls dev_pm_domain_start(),
mysterious things may happen...

So I guess I can provide my
