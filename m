Arguably updating the DTS would be the most accurate option, since it 
would be describing the hardware more correctly, however if there are 
reasons for that not being sufficient (e.g. DTBs baked into firmware, or 
worries of confusing some other DT consumer) then something like the 
below seems reasonable (albeit a little crude) IMO.

Subject: [PATCH] mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: Restore coherency for PPC platforms

Historically, not all PPC platforms have supported per-device coherency,
and some may rely on platform-level assumptions rather than explicitly
specifying the "dma-coherent" propert in their DT. Although the eSDHC
driver needs to tie in to per-device coherency to work correctly on
arm/arm64 platforms, this has apparently caused problems for PPC, so
restore the previous behaviour there with a special case.

coherence")
