OK, driver is fine but no dt-bindings as it is discoverable. It can
also be just a wrapper library instead as it needs no explicit
initialisation like drivers to setup.

Agreed and one must use arm_smccc_get_conduit or something similar. No
additional bindings for each and ever platform and driver that uses SMCCC
please.

Let me know what you think about my thoughts stated above.
