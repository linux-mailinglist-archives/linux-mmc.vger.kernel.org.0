Hi Linus,

With this series, it is no more possible to switch to UHS modes on 
STM32MP1. I will add some traces and try to see what's wrong or missing 
to have it working again.
I've tested on STM32MP157F-EV1 board and got those traces:
[    3.186504] mmc0: Skipping voltage switch
[    3.302170] mmc0: new high speed SDHC card at address aaaa

Whereas with the previous version I had:
[    1.882084] mmc0: new ultra high speed DDR50 SDHC card at address aaaa
[    1.899142] mmcblk0: mmc0:aaaa SC16G 14.8 GiB

On STM32MP13 that can do SDR104 (tested on an internal board), it fails 
to initialized the card:
[    3.194072] mmc0: error -110 whilst initialising SD card

When adding some dynamic debug traces, I can see this in the trace:
[   78.039648] mmc0: Signal voltage switch failed, power cycling card

I'll try to add more traces to see what happens exactly.


Best regards,
Yann
