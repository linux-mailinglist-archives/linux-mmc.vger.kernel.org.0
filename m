Yes, exactly. The IRQ based busy detection code gets disabled with my
debug patch.

It looks like there are some race conditions in the HW busy detection
path for mmci, which gets triggered by this eMMC card.

It can and will.

Although, it's more optimal to receive an IRQ when busy on DAT0 is
de-asserted, rather than polling with ->card_busy(). Hence we also
have MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY.

I will have another look at the code in mmci, to see if there is
something we can try to improve.

Kind regards
Uffe
