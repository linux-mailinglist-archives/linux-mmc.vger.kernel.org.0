Move the common MMC "slot" properties because they are shared by the
single-slot or multi-slot controllers, and will help defining a simple
mmc-slot bindings document with proper slot properties and nodename.

+title: MMC Controller & Slots Common Properties
+
+maintainers:
+  - Ulf Hansson <ulf.hansson@linaro.org>
+
+description: |
+  These properties are common to multiple MMC host controllers and the
+  possible slots or ports for multi-slot controllers.
+
+properties:
+  "#address-cells":
+    const: 1
+    description: |
+      The cell is the slot ID if a function subnode is used.
+
+  "#size-cells":
+    const: 0
+
+  # Card Detection.
+  # If none of these properties are supplied, the host native card
+  # detect will be used. Only one of them should be provided.
+
+  broken-cd:
+    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/flag
+    description:
+      There is no card detection available; polling must be used.
+
+  cd-gpios:
+    maxItems: 1
+    description:
+      The card detection will be done using the GPIO provided.
+
+  non-removable:
+    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/flag
+    description:
+      Non-removable slot (like eMMC); assume always present.
+
+  # *NOTE* on CD and WP polarity. To use common for all SD/MMC host
+  # controllers line polarity properties, we have to fix the meaning
+  # of the "normal" and "inverted" line levels. We choose to follow
+  # the SDHCI standard, which specifies both those lines as "active
+  # low." Therefore, using the "cd-inverted" property means, that the
+  # CD line is active high, i.e. it is high, when a card is
+  # inserted. Similar logic applies to the "wp-inverted" property.
+  #
+  # CD and WP lines can be implemented on the hardware in one of two
+  # ways: as GPIOs, specified in cd-gpios and wp-gpios properties, or
+  # as dedicated pins. Polarity of dedicated pins can be specified,
+  # using *-inverted properties. GPIO polarity can also be specified
+  # using the GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flag. This creates an ambiguity in the
+  # latter case. We choose to use the XOR logic for GPIO CD and WP
+  # lines.  This means, the two properties are "superimposed," for
+  # example leaving the GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flag clear and specifying the
+  # respective *-inverted property property results in a
+  # double-inversion and actually means the "normal" line polarity is
+  # in effect.
+  wp-inverted:
+    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/flag
+    description:
+      The Write Protect line polarity is inverted.

+      Maximum operating frequency of the bus:

+        - for SD/SDIO cards the SDR104 mode has a max supported
+          frequency of 208MHz,
+        - some mmc host controllers do support a max frequency upto
+          384MHz.

+      property should only be specified when the controller has a
+      dedicated write-protect detection logic. If a GPIO is always used
+      for the write-protect detection logic, it is sufficient to not

-  # *NOTE* on CD and WP polarity. To use common for all SD/MMC host

-  # of the "normal" and "inverted" line levels. We choose to follow
-  # the SDHCI standard, which specifies both those lines as "active
-  # low." Therefore, using the "cd-inverted" property means, that the
-  # CD line is active high, i.e. it is high, when a card is
-  # inserted. Similar logic applies to the "wp-inverted" property.
-  #
-  # CD and WP lines can be implemented on the hardware in one of two
-  # ways: as GPIOs, specified in cd-gpios and wp-gpios properties, or
-  # as dedicated pins. Polarity of dedicated pins can be specified,
-  # using *-inverted properties. GPIO polarity can also be specified
-  # using the GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flag. This creates an ambiguity in the
-  # latter case. We choose to use the XOR logic for GPIO CD and WP
-  # lines.  This means, the two properties are "superimposed," for
-  # example leaving the GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flag clear and specifying the
-  # respective *-inverted property property results in a
-  # double-inversion and actually means the "normal" line polarity is
-  # in effect.
