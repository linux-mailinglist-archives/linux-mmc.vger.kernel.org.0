Hi Jason,

So I have worked on some various improvements for this series and have
amended the patches here in v3. It's mostly cosmetic changes along
with some restructuring of the code. I have described the changes in a
specific section in each of the commit messages (please remove these
parts before posting a new version).

git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ulfh/mmc.git wip_uhs2_v3

Going forward, I will continue to review the series and provide you
with some additional comments.

For the next submission, I suggest you start from the branch I
provided above. I would also appreciate it if you can provide some
information of what has changed for each of the patches in the series,
when you post a new version. This makes it easier to review.

Kind regards
Uffe
