Clock controller is a bit exagerated. It's an MMC controller with a
composite input clock and a couple of gates. A fairly common setup.

Also the property does not indicate a "clock controller" (or any number
of clock hosted by the device) but the ability to provide clocks out of
the device.

This device does not actually provide clock externally. Your provider
is just meant to be used internally. It is a work around using DT for
something missing in CCF.

IHMO, it is not such a big deal but since the binding are supposed to be
stable, I'm just pointing out that it is not great.

Again the bindings would be fine if the component was actually providing
the clocks, AFAIU.

Diffstat was not my concern, TBH

I'd be happy if you did
