Yep, I am open to discuss this more.

What if that is the case, should we just return an error?

Moreover, even the device belonging to the mmc card can be runtime
suspended too. So if that is the case, we should return an error too?

I was looking at patch2 and the ->req_cleanup_pending() callback that
you have assigned to cvm_req_cleanup_pending().

In there you clear a potentially running DMA job, which is *kind* of a
reset of the controller. More importantly, it's definitely *not*
terminating an ongoing request, in a way that you can expect the
eMMC/SD card to be ready for new communications afterwards. This is my
main point.

Kind regards
