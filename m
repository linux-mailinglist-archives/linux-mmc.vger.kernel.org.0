Thank you.
I assume that you don't have any objection against adding extra hooks
to sdhci_ops in patch#23 and #25, do you?

If so, since we don't have any critical issues to discuss,
I hope that my changes will be contained in the new version
where a major rework will be done on the core side by Ben.
