Not sure what you mean by operator here? In the end it's a userspace
program running and I assume it can deal with error paths. :-)

In any case, I understand your point.

Exactly.

Many different commands can get pushed down to the card through the
mmc ioctl interface. It's difficult to know what error path we should
pick, other than reporting and propagating the error codes.
