I had a look at the corresponding code in
drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/bcmsdh.c. Yes, it
seems there is a complete cleanup and re-probe being done during
system suspend/resume (it looks heavy and prone to errors, but that's
a different story).

Anyway, it would also be interesting to know if the SDIO
card/interface is failing to be re-initialized correctly by the mmc
core during system resume. Typically, mmc_sdio_resume() in
drivers/mmc/core/sdio.c should not return an error code, but it sounds
like that is the case too, right?

With HW revisions, are you referring to different platform revisions
or revisions of the WiFi module? Or both?

Anyway, in the past we have seen many issues with incorrect HW
descriptions in DT in regards to the mmc-pwrseq. The mmc-pwrseq may be
different both from the platform point of view and from the WiFi
module point of view.

For example, maybe those GPIOs were routed differently on some
platforms, but not correctly described in DT? Or perhaps different
variants of the WiFi module need different power-sequences?

Just wanted to be sure that we really have a broken HW and not just
the description of it. :-)

Correct. The one that is registered with sdio_register_driver().
