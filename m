I see, thanks for sharing this information. Forward/backporting
against 3.18 is hard, perhaps impossible when it comes to this, sorry.

A lot of SDIO core parts, especially related to re-initialization and
power management have been changed since v3.18.

"git log --oneline v3.18..v5.7-rc4 drivers/mmc/core/sdio*" will tell you.

Would it be possible to move to a later kernel and test instead? I
mean, the problem may already have been solved!? mt8173 should be
rather well supported upstream, but perhaps lots are missing for the
SDIO parts?

Alright, that explains the use case, thanks!

An idea to possibly help to narrow down the problem, could be to
implement an "test SDIO func driver" and use that rather than the
mwifiex driver (which I assume is the one you are using?). Then we
could run various tests from it, like calling pm_runtime_get|put() for
example.

We already have a similar thing to replace the mmc/sd block device
driver, so this could be useful for testing SDIO cards/funcs I think.

This sounds a bit like the card gets re-initialized without it first
being properly power cycled.

Perhaps you call mmc_sw_reset() for a "test SDIO func driver", which
re-initializes the card, but without doing a power cycle. Then that
should give you the similar problem?

I keep repeating myself, but there seems to be a problem with the
power cycling of the SDIO card.

If it's the Marvell 8787/8897/8997 SDIO module you are using, you most
likely need a mmc-pwrseq to properly control the power to the SDIO
module. Perhaps that is what is missing?

See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/wireless/marvell-8xxx.txt
and arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3288-veyron.dtsi for an example.

As you are on a 3.18 kernel, the tests seem quite irrelevant, so I
wouldn't bother with the backports.

Kind regards
