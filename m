For eMMC it should be used quite frequently, as CMD6 is sent quite
often, during initialization for example (see mmc_switch() and
__mmc_switch()).

For SD cards, it's being used for erase/trim/discard and while
changing to UHS-I speed modes (1.8V I/O voltage, see
mmc_set_uhs_voltage(). The latter also requires your host driver to
implement the ->start_signal_voltage_switch() host ops, which isn't
the case (yet!?)

For SDIO cards it's being used in-between requests to make sure the
SDIO card is ready for the next command (see __mmc_start_request())

I see.

Depending on what your driver plans to support for the future, see
above, you may need to come back to this in future.

Yes, I think so.

I would also suggest adding a patch that removes the ->card_busy() ops
from the meson driver - and that should probably also carry the same
fixes tag as above. Just to make sure the callback doesn't get used in
some other circumstances, when going forward.

Kind regards
