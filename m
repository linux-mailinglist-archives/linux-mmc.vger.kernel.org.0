SDHCI should be able to handle up to 233MHz IIRC, and there are divisors
available, it depends on the implementation but the worst kind provide /2^n=
.
Not perfect, but good enough for things to work.

Now, I've been having a deeper look into how clocks are handled, and found =
two
new clues:

 - First of all RPi4's sdhci-iproc needs SDHCI_QUIRK_CAP_CLOCK_BASE_BROKEN,
   that is, the controller isn't properly identifying the clock frequency f=
ed
   into it, and defaults to saying it's configured at 100MHz. I'm not an SD=
HCI
   expert, so it's possible changing frequencies also needs a special opera=
tion
   to recalculate this variable. But this was making all internal calculati=
ons
   wrong when paired with this series.

 - With this flag set SDHCI's core now properly calculates divisor values b=
ased
   on whatever clock frequency I set in DT. And guess what, the issue reapp=
ears
   even when running on 150MHz. It turns out, as I had some debugging enabl=
ed,
   the issue only happens when the controller is configured at 100KHz (that
   only happens while running the card detect thread).

So, I can now do this (note that for card detection try to communicate with=
 the
card starting at 400KHz down to 100KHz in 100KHz steps):

 Which is rather nicer than what this series introduces. But I can't still
 explain why configuring the controller at 100KHz is causing the hangs (whi=
le
 having the core clock setup at 500MHz), and I'm not sure if excluding 100K=
Hz
 from the polling frequency list is going to break support for older SD car=
ds.

 Nicolas
