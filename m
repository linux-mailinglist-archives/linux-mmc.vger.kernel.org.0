No idea - I just repaired the SD socket after the D2 line became
disconnected, and decided to run that command as a test.

sdhci-xenon.

I'm just trying with one CPU online, then I'll try with two.  My
suspicion is that there's a problem in the ARM64 arch code where
unlocking a mutex doesn't get noticed on other CPUs.

Hmm, I thought I'd try bringing another CPU online, but it seems
like the ARM64 CPU hotplug code is broken:

[ 3552.029689] CPU1: shutdown
[ 3552.031099] psci: CPU1 killed.
[ 3949.835212] CPU1: failed to come online
[ 3949.837753] CPU1: failed in unknown state : 0x0

which means I can only take CPUs down, I can't bring them back
online without rebooting.
