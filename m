Yes.  "Security" that relies on the driver to fall back to a different
mode doesn't work.

Same here.

The NVMe driver already supports write protected namespaces.

I'll ask my contact in the JEDEC SD card working group if there was
any consideration of the read-only handling for classic SD vs NVMe.
