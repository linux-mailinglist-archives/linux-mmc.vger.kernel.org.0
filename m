Yes, but why is removing the locks okay for the other regular request case?

I assume the locks are there for a reason, right?

I understand the approach you have taken, but what I am saying is that
I don't think it is the best one to choose.

Then I think it's better to invent an entirely new path, rather than
trying to tweak the existing one. For example, in your case you could
leave the lock to be used (in patch2) for the existing regular request
path, but bypass the locks and use polling in the new one.

I wasn't thinking of the block interface, but rather of the internal
behavior of an mmc host driver.

For data transfers, it's common to use DMA when that is supported. If
DMA doesn't work, it's probably a FIFO being read/written to based
upon some IRQs telling when read/write should be done. Of course,
there are other cases as well.

For commands, I expect those to be managed through IRQs.

That said, all these things are preferably managed through a polling
based method instead, when doing the panic writes, correct?

> Do you really think DMA can be avoided for MMC panic writes?

That depends on the HW.

Certainly there are lots of cases where DMA isn't the only way, but
instead it's perfectly possible to fall back to polling based mode.

No, I am not mixing them, but questioning them.

For the non atomic path, I don't understand why the pstore file system
mounting, etc, deserves to be managed through its own specific ops?
Are there any specific reasons for this that I am missing?

In principle, for non atomic path, I would rather see that the pstore
file system should be able to be mounted on top of any generic block
device partition - without requiring the block device driver to
implement specific pstore ops.

Please have a look at the code implementing mmc_claim_host(). It's not
just a simple spin_lock, but there is also a wait_queue and runtime PM
being managed from there.

Well, I don't agree. Resetting the host controller should not be a big
problem, but I am more worried about what state this will bring the
eMMC/SD card in.

It sounds to me that the only option is to try to rely on the
mmc_claim_host() to actually succeed. This makes it certain that there
is no ongoing request that needs to be terminated. Otherwise, things
will just fall apart.

The question is, can/should we rely on mmc_claim_host() to succeed in
this path? Maybe it will work, in cases when there is no ongoing
request, as it means the host should be available to be immediately
claimed. Although, then the problem ends up with runtime PM, as if the
host is available for claiming, it's likely that the host is runtime
suspended...

Exactly. That's why I wonder if it's really worth it to support the
panic writes at all.

I realize that the host driver you are working on doesn't support
runtime PM, so it's not a problem for you, but for many other cases I
assume it would be.

Perhaps we could check that runtime PM is disabled for the mmc host as
a pre-condition to support this feature?

I think you are underestimating the part with terminating ongoing
requests. It sounds to me that you really haven't been terminating any
requests at all, but rather just doing a reset of the mmc controller
(which is what I observed in patch2).

When it comes to adding the new host ops to support the polling
functions, I have in principle no objections to that.

Kind regards
