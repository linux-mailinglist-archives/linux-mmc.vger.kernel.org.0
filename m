I've sent out a new version of this patchset that uses the new function
devm_blk_ksm_init() I've proposed, so that the blk_keyslot_manager no longer
needs to be explicitly destroyed.

Please let me know if you still have any other concerns.

I think you may have been assuming that the blk_keyslot_manager doesn't get
initialized until the CQE is enabled, and thus would have a separate lifetime
from the other host structures?  That's not what happens; it just gets
initialized on the driver probe path.  See e.g.:

	sdhci_msm_probe()
	  => sdhci_msm_cqe_add_host()
	     => cqhci_init()
	        => cqhci_crypto_init()
	           => devm_blk_ksm_init()

And we don't leave MMC_CAP2_CRYPTO set but the blk_keyslot_manager
uninitialized, as that combination doesn't make sense.

Thanks,
