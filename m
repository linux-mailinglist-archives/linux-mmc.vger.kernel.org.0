I was suggesting only the ones for which it works.

It is the host controller that has the problem, not the device.
Hence the quirk.

mmc->max_busy_timeout is calculated by sdhci.c, or the driver can
override the maximum count via ->get_max_timeout_count() or the driver
can override mmc->max_busy_timeout.

With the quirk, sdhci.c will usually set mmc->max_busy_timeout to zero.
That allows timeouts greater than the hardware can support, and then,
with the quirk, the driver will switch to a software timeout when needed.

However, that won't work for every host controller, because some do not
provide a completion interrupt after the timeout, even if the timeout
interrupt is disabled.  That means they should set mmc->max_busy_timeout
to the hardware value.  Hence the quirk is needed to tell the difference.

The mmc core calculates timeouts based on the relevant standards and
values provided by the device itself.

I realise it is an example, but 100 milliseconds is a bit low. Legacy
host controllers have always had to deal with standard SD card and
MMC card timeouts.  SD card write timeout of 500 milliseconds for instance.

Which is what the quirk does.  So I am very confused why the quirk is
no good?
