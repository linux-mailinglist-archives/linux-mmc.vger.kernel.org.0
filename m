Yes, the only safe way to use UHS-I really anyway.
You could disable UHS for u-boot but that still leaves (potentially)
problematic warm-reboots of the board.
Having a (software-controlled) switchable regulator on SD VCC is pretty
common for this reason and you should be able to find it in most dts
for host controllers with sd-uhs-* property.
I'm afraid that the relevant spec section isn't available in the
simplified version.

Kind Regards,
Christian
