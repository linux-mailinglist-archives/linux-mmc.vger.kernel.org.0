Correct.

The device can't be started as runtime PM hasn't been enabled yet for
the device - and this is controlled by the tmio/renesas driver.

Beyond this point there are two main cases to consider.

1. The driver is probed successfully and thus up and running. Then,
when the device becomes runtime suspended (because of request
inactivity, for example), the device will be "stopped" through genpd.

2. The driver failed to probe or the ->remove() callback is invoked
for the device. This will trigger the platform bus to call
dev_pm_domain_detach(). In this path, genpd invokes the
genpd->detach_dev() callback for the device, which allows the genpd
provider to deal with the clean up. In this particular case, I assume
pm_clk_destroy() is going to be called for the device.

Correct.

However, deploying that kind of pattern in a driver can be a bit
messy, while considering that CONFIG_PM may be set or unset and the
driver should work in both configurations. In principle, it leads to
boilerplate code in drivers, especially if the driver has runtime PM
callbacks assigned to it as shown in commit 1b32999e205b ("mmc: tmio:
Avoid boilerplate code in ->runtime_suspend()").

Does it make sense?

Kind regards
