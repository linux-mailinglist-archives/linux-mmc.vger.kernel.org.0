Here are 13 patches against the 'fixes' branch of Ulf Hansson's 'usb.git' repo.
The affected MMC/SD drivers call platform_get_irq() but override its result
in case of error which prevents the deferred probing from working. Some of
these patches logically depend on the previously posted (and yet unmerged)
patch:

https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=163623041902285

Because of that dependency the patches are marked as RFC.
