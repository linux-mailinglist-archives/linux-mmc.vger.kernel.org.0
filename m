Actually its needed even for sc7180. We are making use of this clock in 
msm_init_cm_dll()
The default PoR value is also same as calculated value for 
HS200/HS400/SDR104 modes.
But just not to rely on default register values we need this entry.

By having this, we can optimize emmc device scan time.
Driver wont issue SDIO & SDcards specific commands while
scanning the device.Its little optimization.
I think board specific dt is right place.
