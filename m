Okay, I have applied the $subject patch onto my next branch, along
with patch 1/2 (the DT doc change).

However, I still think we should look for a proper long term solution,
because the kernel_power_off() path does not currently support your
use case, with system wakeups etc.

I guess it could be a topic that is easier to bring up at the Linux
Plumbers Conf, for example.

Kind regards
Uffe
