Hi Adrian,

Thank you for response.

Yes, we are able to retune.

In fact this bug occurs when we iteratively switch to RPMB partition.

May be related to this, we also observed that in __mmc_blk_ioctl_cmd
function in line 487[1] part_index is assigned target_part variable and
on the next line EXT_CSD_PART_CONFIG_ACC_RPMB OR'ed to the target_part
variable.

In mmc_blk_part_switch_pre function line 831 [2], part_type variable is
compared to EXT_CSD_PART_CONFIG_ACC_RPMB without taking into account that
the part_index variable is also OR'ed and its not separated before
the comparision.

Same thing happens in mmc_blk_part_switch_post function.

Is it expected to be this way?, please let me know.
