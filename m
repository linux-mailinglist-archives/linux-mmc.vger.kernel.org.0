Martin, Ulf,

I understand that CCF code might seems verbose and I'm happy to help
review it if necessary but I don't think every driver out there should
register some kind of fake clock controller driver everytime they wish
to use CCF API.

Yes the it might make the driver code cleaner but the overall
architecture is harder to follow.

CCF was made so driver from any subsystem *may* use it. Creating a
controller for a single register is overkill. The HW architecture of
this particular device does not justify it.
