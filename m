That looks wrong. There needs to be one mmc host registered per slot,
otherwise things will, for sure, not work.

I suggest you have a closer look to see what goes on in thunder_mmc_probe().

The serial console should work fine at this point, at least on those
systems that I have tested this code with.

Perhaps you added the debug print too late in the function, if the
calls to disable_irq() or cancel_delayed_work_sync() are hanging?

The code in __mmc_stop_host() has been tested for both polling and
gpio card detections. That said, it looks to me that there is
something weird going on in the cavium mmc driver.

What makes this even tricker, is that it's uncommon and not
recommended to use more than one mmc slot per host instance.

I hope the above thoughts can point you in a direction to narrow down
this problem.
