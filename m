Amlogic

So the "without this" part of that sentence referred to the patch.
Which means that without the patch, the interrupt can be missed.

The vendor driver from openlinux2.amlogic.com handles SDIO interrupts
a bit differently. It uses mmc_signal_sdio_irq()

After doing a more long term stress test, it was revealed that this
patch is still not sufficient, but only masks the underlying problem
better. Reverting 066ecde fixes the issue fully for us (verified
overnight with iperf).
v1 and v2 also fix the issue, but v3 does not correct the bug when
WiFi is stressed for a longer time. And therefore it should not be
used.
Could you please give us some advice on how to investigate this further?
