A series [2] that has been posted by Ulf Hansson which provided some
guidance and an overall structure. This post is the successor version of
series [2]. It is focused on UHS-II card control side to address Ulf's
intention regarding "modularising" sd_uhs2.c.

Some functions in mmc host part must be modified in order to support UHS-II
card control. Those changes are not included in this post.

Kind regards
Jason Lai

 ------ original cover letter from Ulf's series ------
A series [1] that has been collaborative worked upon by Takahiro Akashi
(Linaro) and Ben Chuang (Genesys Logic) is targeting to add SD UHS-II
support
to the mmc subsystem.

Throughout the reviews, we realized that the changes affecting the mmc core
to
support the UHS-II interface/protocol might not be entirely straightforward
to
implement. Especially, I expressed some concerns about the code that
manages
power on/off, initialization and power management of a SD UHS-II card.

Therefore, I have posted this small series to try to help to put some of
the
foundation in the mmc core in place. Hopefully this can provide some
guidance
and an overall structure, of how I think the code could evolve.

More details are available in the commit messages and through comments in
the
code, for each path.

Kind regards
Uffe
