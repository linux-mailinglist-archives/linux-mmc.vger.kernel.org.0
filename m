Strange issue. We never encountered this issue internally.
Please define "post-power-on-delay-ms" dt property with some larger 
delay value (25ms?)
and see if that helps you...

If this doesn't work, let me know the Qcom SoC (name/number) present on 
that phone.
And the kernel that you are using.

Thanks
Veera
