Yes, that seems reasonable.

Well, if it "works " or not, I am not really sure.

My point is, I think most of the things that need to be managed at
system suspend/resume are the same things that need to be managed
during runtime suspend/resume (except wakeups). So, rather than
implementing a whole bunch of system suspend/resume specific things,
why not make use of the runtime suspend/resume callbacks instead.

Kind regards
