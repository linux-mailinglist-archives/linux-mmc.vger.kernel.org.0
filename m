Overall, I suggest you avoid mixing software behaviour with the HW
description. The DT bindings should describe the way the HW works, not
the software.

This applies further down to the description of the new properties as
well. But please, don't get me wrong, I appreciate the detailed
explanations, just make sure it's more focused on describing the HW.

We have moved to describe DT bindings in the yaml format. I would
appreciate it if you make that conversion and then extend it with the
new things, rather than continue to extend the txt based one.

Kind regards
