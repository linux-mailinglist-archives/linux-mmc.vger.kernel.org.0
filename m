ICB team has re-checked the Rennell ICB tool and they confirmed that 
some configs were wrong in Rennell ICB tool and they corrected it.With 
the new updated Rennell ICB tool below are the values :


Rennell LC:(Sc7180)

opp-384000000 {
              opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <384000000>;
              required-opps = <&rpmhpd_opp_nom>;
              opp-peak-kBps = <5400000 490000>;
              opp-avg-kBps = <6600000 300000>;
};


And now, these values are near to Kodaik LC values:

Kodaik LC:(SC7280)

opp-384000000 {
            opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <384000000>;
            required-opps = <&rpmhpd_opp_nom>;
            opp-peak-kBps = <5400000 399000>;
            opp-avg-kBps = <6000000 300000>;
};
