Okay. I will do my best to continue to provide guidance and review.

Perhaps you could also have a closer look at the legacy code for
eMMC/SD, to get some inspiration on how to structure the code in a
consistent way.

By looking at the code, it seems like MMC_UHS2_SUPPORT is redundant,
at least from the mmc core point of view. Everywhere it's used, we use
MMC_UHS2_INITIALIZED too.

Moreover, in patch 2 (mmc: core: Prepare to support SD UHS-II cards) I
added MMC_CAP2_SD_UHS2 as a generic host cap, which is being used in
mmc_attach_sd_uhs2(). This should be sufficient as a generic cap for
UHS2, I think.

In patch 2 (mmc: core: Prepare to support SD UHS-II cards), I added
MMC_TIMING_SD_UHS2. It looks like it tries to serve a similar purpose.

Moreover, I don't see where MMC_UHS2_INITIALIZED is getting set, but I
assume it must be before we try to initialize the card by sending UHS2
specific commands to it, right?

If we compare how we managed things like this for the legacy
interface, this information is kept in the "ios->timing" variable.

Alright, so it's a specific flag for UHS2 commands.

Seems reasonable.

Sounds like this better belongs in the struct uhs2_command.

Please don't.

If it's configurations of the card, the data belongs under struct
sd_uhs2_config. If it's configuration of the host, the data typically
belongs in the struct sd_uhs2_ios.

MMC_UHS2_SPEED_B is typically a speed mode for UHS2. For the legacy
interface in the struct mmc_ios, we have an "unsigned char timing"
variable to keep things like these. We need something similar in the
struct sd_uhs2_ios for this, I think. Maybe we should even turn the
bool for "2L_HD_mode" into being part of this "timing" variable.

When it comes to the MMC_UHS2_INITIALIZED, if I understand correctly,
it means that we have managed to power on the phy and are about to
start the communication with the card. We could use a "bool" in the
struct sd_uhs2_ios, to indicate this. Another option may be to use and
set "MMC_TIMING_SD_UHS2" as a default speed mode in the "timing"
variable above. No matter what, it seems like MMC_TIMING_SD_UHS2
doesn't belong in the legacy ios->variable, as I suggested in patch2.
