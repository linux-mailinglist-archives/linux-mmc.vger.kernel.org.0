Hi Dmitry,

adding checks for ios.timing == MMC_TIMING_MMC_HS400 && host->flags & SDHCI_HS400_TUNING
serves the same purpose for dividing the clk when mode is hs400 and hs400_tuning flag is
set, and clk value checks can be avoided now.

With this HS200, HS400, HS400ES modes of eMMC is tested.

so if this approach looks good to you, then I would like to proceed with next patchset.

Thanks,
Ram
