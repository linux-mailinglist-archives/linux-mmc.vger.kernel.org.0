After changing data rate to Range B, the UHS2 handshake between
host and card is complete. Driver can start to use SD CCMD/DCMD
to control UHS2 SD card. Following listed the usage of UHS2 related
variables:
    MMC_TIMING_SD_UHS2 in host->ios.timing:
        - Enable UHS2 interface on host controller (drivers/mmc/host)
        - Read preset value from Preset Value Register of SD Host
Controller. (drivers/mmc/host)
    MMC_UHS2_SPEED_B in card->uhs2_state:
        - Used to indicate if current sd card supports UHS2 Range B data rate.
    MMC_UHS2_INITIALIZED in card->uhs2_state:
        - Used to indicate if UHS2 PHY handshaking between host
controller and sd card is complete.

It should be set here:
int mmc_app_cmd(struct mmc_host *host, struct mmc_card *card)
{
    int err;
    struct mmc_command cmd = {};
    [...]
    if (card->uhs2_state & MMC_UHS2_INITIALIZED) {
        host->uhs2_ios.is_APP_CMD = true;
        /* UHS2 does not support APP command(CMD55). It use APP bit in
UHS2 command argument to indicate APP CMD */
        return 0;
    }
    [...]

uhs2_cmd is a local variable in mmc_start_request() and mmc_cqe_start_req().

The driver I mentioned above generally includes core/sd/sd_uhs2/mmc_ops.
If we put all initialization flows in one function, MMC_UHS2_SPEED_B will be
declared as a local variable. I try to use a pseudo code to describe
their usage:

int uhs2_init(struct mmc_host *host)
{
    bool    isRangeB_supported;
    int     err;

    err = phy_init();

The mode will be kept until hw_reset/sd_uhs2_power_off/sd_uhs2_remove
being removed. So we can reach the goal by putting some pr_info() there
and check the mode in system log.

You are right.
In UHS-II Addendum v1.02, Figure 3-10: UHS-II Transaction by SD-TRAN can
help you learn more about SD-TRAN and "Figure 3-11: UHS-II  Initialization Flow"
shows the initialization sequence of uhs2 interface:

Power On or FULL_RESET --> PHY Initialization --> Device Initialization -->
         Enumeration --> Configuration --> Active

After sd card enters Active state, host can start to execute legacy sd
command via sdhci_uhs2_ops.send_command.
mmc_wait_for_cmd --> mmc_wait_for_req
--> __mmc_start_req --> mmc_start_request -> __mmc_start_request
--> host->ops->request==sdhci_request
--> sdhci_send_command_retry --> sdhci_send_command
--> sdhci_uhs2_ops.send_command==sdhci_uhs2_send_command

I will submit V4, which does not contain uhs2 host driver, in these 2 days for
your review. As for adding uhs2 host part, you prefer adding in V6 or
create another series of patches?
