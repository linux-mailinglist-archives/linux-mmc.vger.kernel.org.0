This helps to avoid lower speed modes running in high clock rate,
and As Veerabhadrarao Badiganti mentioned

This will align clock requests between mmc core layer and sdhci-msm
platform driver. Say, for HS200/HS400 modes of eMMC, mmc-core layer
tries to set clock at 200Mhz, whereas sdhci-msm expects 192Mhz for
these modes. So we have to rely on clock driver floor/ceil values.
By having this property, mmc-core layer itself request for 192Mhz.

Same is for SD card SDR104 mode, core layer expects clock at 208Mhz
whereas sdhci-msm can max operate only at 202Mhz. By having this
property, core layer requests only for 202Mhz for SDR104 mode.

BTW, this helps only for max possible speed modes.
In case of lower-speed modes (for DDR52) we still need to rely on clock
floor rounding.
