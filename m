Hi Shawn,

thank you for remembering that previous discussion, that is a
good question. Looking at the code though, I don't actually
see any part of mmc_io_rw_direct() doing DMA on a caller-provided
buffer. The only thing I see in the code is a 'u8 *out' argument, but
that is just a pointer to a single byte that is set by this function.

Do you see any other issue with that function, or does that mean
we don't have to change it?

       Arnd
