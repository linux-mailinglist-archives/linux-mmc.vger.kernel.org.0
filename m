Mh, where is it specified that the erase command is fast? According
to the Physical Layer Simplified Specification Version 8.00:

  The actual erase time may be quite long, and the host may issue CMD7
  to deselect the card or perform card disconnection, as described in
  the Block Write section, above.

Honest question. Also reading "4.14 Erase Timeout Calculation" doesn't
sound that it is fast.

Also there is this comment:

I've already tested that "mkfs.ext4 -E nodiscard" is fast (or works in
the same way as before the pre-discard feature).

But I wouldn't say it is a cheapo card (Toshiba Exceria). Although I
cannot guarantee that it might be a china clone, but it looks authentic
;)

Yeah I'm aware of the Tesla eMMC wear-out problem. But I've seen this
esp. from a user point of view. Like take our product, where the user
can freely choose its sdcard just to then notice that the installation
of its distribution is painfully slow. So I'm interested in 
understanding
the implications. Like is it really the case that the erase command can
be assumed fast.
