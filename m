Probably original question from Joao was not fully understood.

It is clear why the code is waiting for the CD, the issue we are
experiencing is that the whole boot is delayed by 1.5 seconds because of
that piece of code for no reason.

- SD card exists in the system, but it's not used and the card slot is empty
- We boot from eMMC (that has no CD pin)
- Boot is delayed by 1.5 second because of that piece of code
