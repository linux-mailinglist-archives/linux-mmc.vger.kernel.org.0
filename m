The "built-in self-test" that the ICE hardware does seems to be a FIPS
compliance thing which never actually fails in practice.

If it does fail, then according to
https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/documents/security-policies/140sp2588.pdf
(which is the closest thing I have to any documentation for ICE, other than the
eMMC standard), then the hardware itself will reject any crypto requests.  So
rejecting them in software too should be redundant.

It's also worth noting that just because a hardware-level self-test passes
doesn't mean that the actual end-to-end storage encryption is working correctly.
To verify that you need to run something like Android's
vts_kernel_encryption_test, or the ciphertext verification tests in xfstests.
The hardware itself is really the wrong place to be testing the encryption.

It would be possible to add some code that sets a flag in the cqhci_host if the
ICE hardware test fails, and make cqhci_request() fail any crypto-enabled
requests if that flag is set.  It just doesn't seem necessary, and I think we
should error on the side of less complexity for now.

What I was actually worried about is what happens if ICE needs to be used but
its self-test is still running, so it doesn't want to accept requests yet.  I'm
not sure that's really a thing or not (one might hope the MMC host doesn't say
it's done resetting until the ICE tests are done), but that's why I left in the
code that waits for the tests to complete, which the downstream driver had.

Neeraj and Barani, if you have any additional insight or suggestions on this, or
know of anything I may be overlooking, that would be greatly appreciated.

Otherwise I just plan to add a comment that summarizes what I said above.

Yes but I don't think it matters.  IIUC, if a device's ->runtime_resume()
callback fails, then Linux's runtime power management framework keeps the device
in an error state and doesn't consider it to be resumed.

So if resuming a device involves N different things, and one of them fails, I
don't think we need to worry about trying to still do the other N-1 things; we
can just return an error on the first failure.
