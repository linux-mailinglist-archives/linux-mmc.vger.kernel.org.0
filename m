> For gpio-regulator, I believe I could not use the current gpio-regulator.c framework as there is no consumer API for me to change the state of gpio pin during voltage switching.

The consumer API you want to use, is the regulator consumer API,
regulator_enable|disable(), for example.

Although, as I stated earlier, the mmc core already provides helper
functions for this. I suggest you have a look at
mmc_regulator_set_vqmmc() and how it's used by other mmc host drivers.

I don't think so. Please have a look at
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/gpio-regulator.yaml. This
allows you to specify your GPIO regulator in DT.

Then from the mmc node you add a "vqmmc-supply" specifier with the
phandle to the regulator - that should be it.

Kind regards
Uffe
