There have been several attempts to fix this and me personally don't
have a problem with using aliases/labels in DT. I said that before as
well.

However, what is missing today, is that someone collects the proper
arguments for *why* this is needed (and especially why UUID/LABEL
doesn't work). I think all that information is available in the
discussion here: https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/cover/674381/

When I see a new patch posted, that contains these arguments in the
commit message of the patch, I am ready to review it again.

Kind regards
Uffe
