Basically yes.

Yes, it works! I have not even played with the wlan_en regulator =
voltage.

Indeed we can. That is great.

Now the question is how to handle the dependency on your patch.
Somehow we must ensure that it is merged before my $subject patch.
Even if someone decides to backport this to stable.

BR and thanks,
