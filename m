The blk_keyslot_manager is initialized early on when the other host structures
(struct mmc_host, struct cqhci_host, struct sdhci_host, struct sdhci_msm_host)
are initialized, prior to mmc_add_host().

It is destroyed when the struct mmc_host is freed by mmc_free_host().

So it should just work; it's the same lifecycle as the existing host structures.
Is there something you think I'm overlooking?
