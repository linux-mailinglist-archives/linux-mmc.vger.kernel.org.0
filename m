Huh, that sounds bad. Thanks for sharing.

The reason for my question is that I am looking over the timeout_ms
argument that callers of __mmc_switch() provides. I will post a couple
of patches asap for this. A 10 minute timeout is really silly for any
type of operation.

Anyway, that's a different story.

That's true, but unfortunately there are quite many HWs that doesn't
support the busy signalling, but relies on this polling loop.

When it comes to the BKOPS case, that's probably a rather seldom case,
with a longer timeout and where the granularity doesn't matter so
much.

For other *mmc_switch() calls, such as those during card
initialization, these are critical for boot time, system resume and
runtime resume time. I think most of these switch operations, uses the
generic_cmd6_time as timeout_ms, which means a timeout in the ballpark
of a few hundred milliseconds (default is 500ms). However, in many of
these cases I think we may even spend less than 1 ms in the loop as of
today, but that needs to be verified.

That said, we probably need a lower start value than 1ms and perhaps
make the upper limit lower and dynamically changed, depending on the
provided timeout_ms.

So, before going on playing with this, we need to get some more
details of how the loop behaves currently, especially for switch
commands during the card initialization.

Kind regards
Uffe
