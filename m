I'm sorry, but I don't know what a BCM57765/57785 even is but it is from some time in 2010 or earlier - nothing I have seen or worked on.
I looked at our groups internal bug database and we have experienced issues with card detection or high speed usage on other products in the past.
Some fixes needed have been resetting the SD card after the bootloader to get card into a known state, controlling gpios to set voltages for ultra high speed modes, DDR50 tuning, and what not.

I don't know what your specific issue for that card.
