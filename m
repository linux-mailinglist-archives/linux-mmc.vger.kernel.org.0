It will cause an issue for many cards and might break some cards.

There is no 'switching back' to 3.3V signalling from UHS 1.8V.
The only way this can be done is therefore a full power-off.
Is that done correctly for your system?
AFAIR spec dictates 500ms of <0.5V on VCC. Note that  driving CLK/signal
lines can also sustain the card somewhat, as leakage is only limited
within operating voltage.
