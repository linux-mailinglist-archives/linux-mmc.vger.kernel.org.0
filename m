Hi Muhammad,

thanks for your patch!

I think I understand this part.

That much is clear.

And that is an SMC call like that:

+static inline int keembay_io_rail_supplied_voltage(int volt)
+{
+       struct arm_smccc_res res;
+
+       arm_smccc_1_1_invoke(ARM_SMCCC_SIP_KEEMBAY_SET_SD_VOLTAGE, volt, &r=
es);
+       if ((int)res.a0 < 0)
+               return -EINVAL;
+
+       return 0;

That can set the voltage by calling into the Arm secure world I guess?

I don't see why this would be pin control related, and that is as
you point out leading to some confused discussions here.

We do have something like this generic pin config:

 * @PIN_CONFIG_POWER_SOURCE: if the pin can select between different power
 *      supplies, the argument to this parameter (on a custom format) tells
 *      the driver which alternative power source to use.

But it's ... yeah. It usually has a very specific purpose of selecting
one of two available voltage rails inside the SoC. And it needs to
apply to one pin or pin group. Also it kind of implies that those
voltages are always on.

As you say:

The keembay_io_rail_supplied_voltage() more resembles a
selector (choose one on a menu) voltage regulator to me
if anything.

Yeah it has to be called from somewhere, if you want an abstraction
to make the driver neutral to any machine, then use a
selector regulator. It can be placed
anywhere in the kernel as long as you can reference it.

The register is called (according to the code) AON_CGF1
(really? not AON_CFG1?) and the "ON" part in "AON"  makes
it sound like "analog ON" implying this is something that can be
turned on/off and configured into two voltages and it has been
wrapped in these custom SMCCs by a secure world developer
(right?)

If it should use any abstraction it should be a selector regulator
IMO and while that may seem overengineered it adds something
because regulators are used in  the MMC subsystem for vdd
and vqmmc because we are handling the OCR mask with that
and it can support any amount of present and future
voltages for signal levels with that as well. Any future changes
to how the different signal voltages are set or which voltages
exist can then be done in that regulator driver.

Just my =E2=82=AC0.01...
