Ohh, I didn't look that close. In that case the code isn't doing what
it *should*. The point is really to match on the compatible string and
then add quirks if that is found.

Let me have a closer look - and for sure, I am willing to help if needed.

We can call mmc_fixup_device() more than once during initialization
and provide different struct mmc_fixup* - if that is needed.

Yes. I thought that should be possible, but maybe it is not?

Okay, I will have a closer look. Maybe we need to extend the card
quirks interface a bit to make it suitable for this case too.
