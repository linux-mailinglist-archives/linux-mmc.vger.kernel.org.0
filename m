Unfortunate, I think there is even more complexity involved here. I
don't think the above work for all cases.

Let me try to elaborate - there are two scenarios of when mmc_remove()
is called.

1)
When the card becomes removed, likely not the case for eMMC but it may
happen for a legacy MMC card, for example. In this case, there is not
much we can do to fix the problem, as the card is already "dead".

2)
The card is working properly (it may be suspended though) while
mmc_remove_host() gets called because the host driver is being
unbinded.

For 1)
We should only clean up and remove the card structs, which the current
code already does.

For 2)
We want to support a graceful power off sequence or the card (to
prevent data corruption for example). However, depending on the
platform and host, it may not be possible to power off both VCC and
VCCQ. For example, it's quite common that VCCQ remains powered on,
while only VCC can be power gated. Just disabling the power off
notification of the eMMC card (as you suggest above), doesn't really
help. In fact, it could mean that we may violate the eMMC spec when
power gating VCC through mmc_power_off().

I am thinking of a few possible solutions. Perhaps easier if I post a
patch that you try - unless you have ideas yourself of how to fix
this.
