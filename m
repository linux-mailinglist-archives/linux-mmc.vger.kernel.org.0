I think the device is intended to be used with GPIO card detection.
Polling mode shouldn't be needed if there is GPIO.

Anyway, to me it sounds like the HW/controller isn't properly
initialized during ->probe(), but I can't help you much more than
that. I have looped in some of the recent active sdhci-msm developers
to see if they have some ideas that we can try.

Kind regards
