If I drop the debug logs you mentioned so that I can actually see what's
going on (they produce hundreds of lines / sec), here's what the Wi-Fi card
actually reports with, vs without, MMC bounce buffers.  With bounce buffers on,
it takes several tries to load the firmware, and it can't authenticate to any
network.  I've tested and confirmed this effect on multiple consoles, across
multiple reboots, on multiple Wi-Fi networks.  Meanwhile with MMC bounce buffers
off, it's much more functional.
