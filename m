Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker. Top-posting
for once, to make this easily accessible to everyone.

I still have this regression (caused by a commit from Brian, applied by
Ulf) on my list of tracked issues. Was there any progress to finally get
this fixed[1]? Doesn't look like it from here, but I might have easily
missed something, that's why I'm asking.

[1] this patch from Ziyang Huang afaics was supposed to help, but it
went nowhere afaics
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-amlogic/TYZPR01MB5556B56D834E02F41C44D81DC95FA@TYZPR01MB5556.apcprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com/

Or does anybody stop caring?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
