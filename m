I have considered doing this, but this means reprogramming the signal
voltage to 3.3V at a time when the card does not expect this, is this ok?

We would then also need to recall the DSM to put the voltage back to 1.8V
from resume. I have a feeling that this is probably what Windows does
(I guess it moves the entire card back to a more safe IOS mode before
suspend), accidentally avoiding the bug.

I assume you want to only call the DSM to set the voltage to 3.3V on
the affected model, or do you want to do this on all machines ?

Adding this does seem to introduce more complexity then simply disabling
1.8V modes and given that it is just a single model which is affected
I went with the more simple option of just disabling the 1.8V modes.

Ideally we would not need any quirks, but if we do we should at least
make the work-around as simple as possible. So I've a slight preference
for just sticking with DHCI_QUIRK2_NO_1_8_V ...

Note that the suspend/resume handling is broken also in the sense that
it does not disable the signal voltage during suspend.

The module parameter is purely to make testing if the same quirk(s)
help on other devices easier. Like the debug_quirks[2] params in sdhci.c
